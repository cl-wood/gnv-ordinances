(Ord. No. 211331, § 1, 10-20-22)

#### DIVISION 4. PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS

Sec. 30-3.15. Purpose.

A. *Purpose.* The purpose of the planned development (PD) district is to provide a particularized zoning district that recognizes unique conditions, allows design flexibility, and promotes planned diversification and integration of uses and structures, which other zoning districts cannot accommodate, while also retaining the city commission's authority to establish such limitations and regulations as it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare. The PD district is designed to:

1. Encourage flexible land development that sustainably uses land and infrastructure, reduces transportation needs, conserves energy, and maximizes the preservation of natural resources.

2. Allow the integration of different land uses and densities in one development that would not otherwise be provided for in other zoning districts in this chapter, and which encourage compatibility in overall site design and scale both internal and external to the project site.

3. Permit outstanding and innovative residential and nonresidential developments with quality-of-life design features, such as an integration of housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods; design that encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel by foot, bicycle, and transit through such strategies as pedestrian scale, a building orientation generally toward streets and sidewalks, parking located to the side or rear of buildings, narrow streets, modest setbacks, front porches, connected streets, multiple connections to nearby land uses, terminated vistas, recessed garages, alleys, enhances landscaping, and mixed-uses.

4. Provide flexibility to meet changing needs, technologies, economics, and consumer preferences and allows for ingenuity and imagination in the planning and development of relatively large tracts.

5. Achieve overall coordinated building and facility relationships and infill development, and eliminate the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development.

Sec. 30-3.16. Applicability of other regulations.

All building code, housing code and other land use regulations of this chapter are applicable to a PD, except to the extent that they conflict with a specific provision of an approved PD.

Sec. 30-3.17. Review criteria.

In addition to the general review criteria for rezonings provided by this article, the city plan board and the city commission shall evaluate PD applications according to the following additional criteria:

A. *Consistent with Comprehensive Plan.* A PD application may only be approved if it is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.

B. *Conformance to PD purpose.* A PD application may only be approved if it is in conformance with the purpose of PDs as articulated in section 30-3.15.

C. *Internal compatibility.* All uses proposed within a PD shall be compatible with other proposed uses; that is, no use may have any undue adverse impact on any neighboring use, based on the streetscape, treatment of pedestrian ways and circulation, motor vehicle circulation, and the separation and buffering of parking areas and sections of parking areas; the existence or absence of, and the location of, focal points and vistas, open spaces, plazas, recreational areas and common areas, and use of existing and proposed landscaping; use of the topography, physical environment and other natural features; use and variety of building setback or build-to lines, separations and buffering; use and variety of building groupings, building sizes, architectural styles, and materials; variety and design of dwelling types; particular land uses proposed, and conditions and limitations thereon; and any other factor deemed relevant to the privacy, safety, preservation, protection or welfare of any proposed use within the PD.

D. *External compatibility.* All uses proposed within a PD shall be compatible with existing and planned uses of properties surrounding the PD; that is, no internal use may have any avoidable or undue adverse impact on any existing or planned surrounding use, nor shall any internal use be subject to undue adverse impact from existing or planned surrounding uses. An evaluation of the external compatibility of a PD should be based on the following factors: adjacent existing and proposed uses, design of the development, traffic circulation, and density and intensity.

E. *Intensity of development.* The residential density and intensity of use of a PD shall be compatible with and shall have no undue adverse impact upon the physical and environmental characteristics of the site and surrounding lands, and shall comply with the policies and density limitations set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. Within the maximum limitation of the Comprehensive Plan, the permitted residential density and intensity of use in a PD may be adjusted upward or downward in consideration of the following factors: the availability and location of public and utility services and facilities; the trip capture rate of development; and the degree of internal and external connectedness of streets.

F. *Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas.* Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas provided within a PD shall be evaluated based on conformance with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and the sufficiency of such areas to provide appropriate recreational opportunities, protect sensitive environmental areas, conserve areas of unique beauty or historical significance, enhance neighborhood design, and encourage compatible and cooperative relationships between adjoining land uses.

G. *Environmental constraints.* The site of the PD shall be suitable for use in the manner proposed without hazards to persons either on or offsite from the likelihood of increased flooding, erosion or other dangers, annoyances or inconveniences. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to the type, pattern and intensity of development intended. The conditions and requirements of the protection of resources article shall be met.

H. *External transportation access.* A PD shall be located on, and provide access to, a major street (arterial or collector) unless, due to the size of the PD and the type of uses proposed, it will not adversely affect the type or amount of traffic on adjoining local streets. Access shall meet the standards set in chapter 23 and chapter 30, article VI. Connection to existing or planned adjacent streets is encouraged. The trip generation report shall be signed by a professional engineer registered in the state when there is a difference between the traffic report provided by the petitioner and the concurrency test.

I. *Internal transportation access.* Every dwelling unit or other use permitted in a PD shall have access to a public street directly or by way of a private road, pedestrian way, court or other area that is either dedicated to public use or is a common area guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a dedicated public road. Private roads and other accessways shall be required to be constructed so as to ensure that they are safe and maintainable.

J. *Provision for the range of transportation choices.* Sufficient off-street and on-street parking for bicycles and other vehicles, as well as cars, shall be provided. Parking areas shall be constructed in accordance with such standards as are approved by the city commission to ensure that they are safe and maintainable and that they allow for sufficient privacy for adjoining uses. When there is discretion as to the location of parking in the project, it is strongly encouraged that all motor vehicle parking be located at the rear or interior side of buildings, or both. The design of a PD should, whenever feasible, incorporate appropriate pedestrian and bicycle accessways so as to provide for a variety of mobility opportunities. Connection to all sidewalks, greenways, trails, bikeways, and transit stops along the perimeter of the PD is required. Where existing perimeter sidewalks do not exist, sidewalks shall be provided by the development.

Sec. 30-3.18. Review procedures.

A. *Unified control.* All land included in any PD application must be owned or under the legal control of the applicant, whether the applicant be an individual, partnership, corporation, other entity, group or agency. The applicant shall provide evidence of such ownership or control, including upon request of the city manager or designee all agreements, contracts, guarantees and other necessary documents and information that the city deems necessary.

B. *Pre-application meeting.* Before application submittal, the applicant shall present a generalized description of the project to the city manager or designee at a pre-application conference.

C. *First-step meeting.* Before application submittal, the applicant shall attend a first-step meeting to discuss the development review process, code requirements and to confer with staff about the PD. Comments made by staff at a first-step meeting are made solely for preliminary informational purposes and may not be construed as an approval or denial or agreement to approve or deny any application.

D. *Application submittal.* The applicant shall submit a complete application, accompanied by the applicable fee, on a form provided by the city together with all plans, documentation, and information deemed necessary by the city.

E. *Development review director review.* The development review director shall review the application for conformance with the city's Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Code, and issue a recommendation.

F. *Neighborhood workshop.* The applicant shall hold a neighborhood workshop per the requirements of this article.

G. *City plan board review.* The city plan board shall review the application (PD layout plan and report) at a public hearing. The city plan board shall recommend denial, approval, or approval subject to conditions, and the recommendation must be forwarded to the city commission for consideration.

H. *City commission review.*

1. The city commission shall deny the application, approve the application, or approve the application with conditions that it deems necessary and appropriate.

2. If the city commission approves an application with conditions, then the applicant shall revise the application to clearly incorporate such conditions and file with the city manager or designee within 60 calendar days of such approval. Failure to file the revised application within the time prescribed will render any approval of the city commission null and void unless the applicant files with the city commission a written request for an extension of time within such 60-day period. The city commission may grant an extension for good cause shown.

(Ord. No. 200722, § 5, 4-21-22)

Sec. 30-3.19. Phasing.

The city commission may allow or require the phasing of a PD. When provisions for phasing are included in a PD, each phase shall be planned and related to previous development, surrounding properties and the available public facilities and services so that a failure to proceed with phases will have no adverse impact on the PD or surrounding properties.

Sec. 30-3.20. Development time limits.

The city commission may establish reasonable time limits for the completion of any dedicated public facilities within a PD, facilities planned for common areas, and the total PD. If phasing is provided for, time limits for the completion of each phase may also be established or may be deferred until development review. Any such time limit may be extended by the city commission for an additional reasonable time limit upon the written request of an applicant and based upon good cause, as determined by the city commission. Any such extension shall not automatically extend the normal expiration date of a building permit, site plan approval or other development order.

Sec. 30-3.21. Amendments.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an amendment to an approved PD (except for an extension of a time limit) shall be accomplished only by a new PD rezoning application.

B. The following types of amendments to the requirements of an approved PD may be authorized by the appropriate reviewing board during development plan review, provided such amendments meet the criteria set forth in this article for the development review process:

1. Minor adjustments or shifts in the location and siting of buildings, structures, parking bays, and parking spaces.

2. Changes in the location of utility tie-ins and solid waste, recycling, and yard trash containers.

3. Reductions in the overall density or intensity of structural ground coverage of the development.

4. Changes in the location and types of landscape materials, excluding changes in location of buffers.

5. Minor changes in the walkway and bikeway systems.

At the request of the applicant and for good cause shown, the city plan board may extend the time of the permit's expiration for good cause shown and if not in conflict with any other provision of this chapter.

D. *Abandonment.* On request of the permit holder, the city manager or designee may approve the abandonment of a special use permit provided no construction has begun. In addition, if the use allowed by a special use permit has been abandoned for a continuous period of 12 months, the permit shall be void. The process to determine whether a use has been abandoned shall be the same as that provided for nonconforming uses in article X.

E. *Revocation.* If any conditions of an issued special use permit are violated, the city plan board may, after giving proper notice to the permit holder, revoke the permit at a public hearing. The permit may be reinstated by the city manager or designee if the circumstances leading to the revocation are corrected.

#### DIVISION 6. WELLFIELD PROTECTION SPECIAL USE PERMIT

Sec. 30-3.31. Review procedures.

A. *Pre-application meeting.* The applicant for a WPSUP shall meet with staff to discuss the procedures and requirements and to consider the elements of the proposed use and site, and the proposed site plan.

B. *Applications.* Applications shall be filed with the city manager or designee on the form prescribed. Any incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant.

Applications shall include a development plan. However, if any of the items required for the development plan are inapplicable or irrelevant to a proposed development, such item may be omitted upon approval of the appropriate staff, provided the applicant identifies in writing any missing item and includes a brief explanation of why it is inapplicable or irrelevant. The city plan board may, at the public hearing, approve the omission of items from the development plan if it finds they are not relevant to a determination that the proposed use or development meets the requirements of this division.

C. *Staff review.* Staff from Gainesville Regional Utilities, Alachua County Environmental Protection Department, and the city shall review the request and submit to the city plan board a written analysis of the application and a recommendation based on the criteria provided in this division.

D. *City plan board hearing.*

1. The city plan board shall consider the evidence presented in the public hearing and the written report submitted by staff and shall act on the application based on the review criteria provided in this division.

2. Action on the application shall be one of the following:

a. Approval;

b. Approval subject to conditions; or

c. Denial, with a statement of the reasons for denial.

E. *Effect of denial or withdrawal.* No application for a WPSUP may be submitted within two years after the date of denial or withdrawal of a request for the same use for the same property. The city plan board may waive this time limitation by the affirmative vote of five members, provided 30 calendar days have elapsed and provided the city plan board deems such action necessary to prevent an injustice.

F. *Amended application.* Amendment of an application may be allowed at any time prior to or during the public hearing, provided that no such amendment shall be such as to make the case different from its description in the notice of public hearing. If the amendment is requested by the applicant after notice of the hearing has been given and such amendment is at variance with the information set forth in the notice, then the applicant shall pay an additional fee in the same amount as the original fee for amended public notice. If the amended notice can be mailed at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing originally scheduled, the hearing on the amended petition may be held on that date; otherwise, the chairperson shall announce at the public hearing that the hearing will be continued to a future meeting with proper public notice.

Sec. 30-3.32. Effect and limitations.

A. *Effect.* WPSUPs, including any permit conditions, shall run with the land and shall be binding on the original applicant as well as any successors or assigns. If there is a change of ownership or operator at the development site, the new owner or operator shall inform the city of its identity and registered agent for service of notice within 30 calendar days. Failure to do so shall be considered a violation of a condition of the permit.

B. *Modifications.* After approval and issuance of a WPSUP, the following situations are allowed only with the review and issuance of a new special use permit:

1. A change in the boundaries of the approved site.

2. A change from the approved use.

3. An increase in the storage capacity or type of any hazardous materials used, manufactured, sold or stored at the site, including new hazardous materials not previously listed in the original WPSUP. This criterion shall not apply to hazardous materials excluded from the provisions of the Alachua County Hazardous Materials Management Code, as may be amended from time to time.

C. *Expiration.* WPSUPs shall expire 12 months after the date of approval unless, at that time, the authorized use has commenced or development at the site is continuing in good faith with an active building permit. At the request of the applicant and for good cause shown, the city plan board may extend the time of the permit's expiration for good cause shown and if not in conflict with any other provision of this chapter.

D. *Abandonment.* On request of the permit holder, the city manager or designee may approve the abandonment of a WPSUP provided no construction has begun. In addition, if the use allowed by a WPSUP has been abandoned for a continuous period of 12 months, the permit shall be void. The process to determine whether a use has been abandoned shall be the same as that provided for nonconforming uses in article X.

E. *Revocation.* If any conditions of an issued WPSUP are violated, the city plan board may, after giving proper notice to the permit holder, revoke the permit at a public hearing. The permit may be reinstated by the city manager or designee if the circumstances leading to the revocation are corrected.

#### DIVISION 7. SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 30-3.33. Purpose.

This division is intended to provide standards for the division of land in a manner that would facilitate the coordination of land development in accordance with orderly physical patterns; to encourage development of an economically stable and healthful community; to ensure proper identification, monumentation and recording of real estate boundaries; to ensure that adequate and necessary physical improvements of lasting quality will be installed in subdivisions by the subdividers and that taxpayers will not bear this cost; to provide for safe and convenient vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian and transit access; to provide an efficient, adequate, and economic supply of utilities and services to new land developments; to prevent periodic or seasonal flooding and to protect groundwater and surface water quality through provision of protective flood control and stormwater management facilities; to help conserve and protect physical and scenic resources; to sustain and replenish the urban forest; to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, and general welfare; and to implement the Comprehensive Plan.

Sec. 30-3.34. Lot splits and lot line adjustments.

A. *Lot splits.* Lot splits shall be processed as follows:

1. *Lot split restrictions.* Lot splits are not permitted in minor subdivisions approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. No further division of an approved lot split is permitted, unless a minor subdivision or record plat is prepared and submitted in accordance with this chapter. Only those lot splits that do not require any street, sidewalk, bikeway, bridge, drainage facility, screening wall or any other improvement required under this chapter may be processed under this section.

2. *Lot split standards.* Each proposed lot shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. Each lot shall front a public street or approved private street for the required minimum lot width for the zoning district where the lots are located, except as provided in section 30-6.8. If any lot abuts a public right-of-way that does not conform to the design specifications provided in section 30-6.6 B., as further specified in the Design Manual, the owner may be required to dedicate, at no cost to the city, one-half of the right-of-way width necessary to meet the minimum design requirements. A lot split shall be allowed only where water, sewer, fire and solid waste services are available to service the proposed lots. Alternately, in the event city water or sewer is not available at any lot line, the lot may be served by a well or septic tank; provided the lot is a minimum size of one acre and the well or septic tank is permitted and approved by the governmental agencies with jurisdiction. Based on the review by the governmental permitting agencies, a well or septic tank may not be allowed within the wellfield districts, special environmental concern areas or areas with the presence of hazardous materials or known environmental contamination, due to health and safety concerns. Further, at the time city water or sewer become available at the lot line, the property owner shall, at its sole expense, connect to city water or sewer. This connection requirement shall run with the land and shall be evidenced in a written document executed by the property owner and recorded in the public records of Alachua County, Florida, at the time of approval of the lot split. In the case of a vacant lot, the connection shall be required at the time of application for development. In the case of existing development (other than single-family or two-family), the connection shall be required at the time of application for development plan review at the rapid review level or higher. In the case of single-family or two-family development, the connection shall be required at the time of application for a permit for an additional bathroom or for any structure equal to or greater than 25 percent of the square footage of the existing principal structure.

3. *Review.*

a. *Application.* After a mandatory pre-application conference with staff, an application shall be completed on a form prescribed by the city and submitted together with the following:

i. A boundary survey and lot split for the proposed division prepared by a professional land surveyor registered in the state according to F.S. Ch. 472. The proposed lot split shall show the intended division, legal descriptions, and acreage for the parent parcel and proposed lots.

ii. A statement indicating the location where water or sanitary sewer service is available to the property, and a statement indicating that all utility service shall be installed beneath the surface of the ground in accordance with section 30-8.2.

b. Upon receipt of a completed application, the several departments of the city shall review and provide comment.

c. If the proposed lot split meets the conditions of this section and otherwise complies with all applicable laws and ordinances, the city manager or designee shall approve the lot split by affixing his or her signature to the application form.

d. Upon approval of the lot split, the city shall record the split on the appropriate maps and documents in the city. In addition, the applicant shall file lot splits with the Alachua County Property Appraiser's office and in the public records of Alachua County.

B. *Lot line adjustments.* The lot lines of lots within an existing minor subdivision or existing lot split may be altered in accordance with the following requirements:

1. A lot line adjustment shall only be used to adjust the lot lines of existing lots that were created by minor subdivision or lot split and shall not be used to further subdivide existing lots or create new lots.

2. An application for a lot line adjustment, signed by the owners of all lots that will be adjusted, shall be completed on a form prescribed by the city and submitted together with a surveyor's affidavit prepared by a professional land surveyor registered in the state that describes and depicts the adjustment in the lot lines and references the filing or recording information for the minor subdivision or lot split.

3. The applicant shall pay the same fee as for a lot split as specified in appendix A.

4. The application shall be reviewed by city staff to verify that the requested adjustment, if approved, will not create any nonconformity or violations of this chapter. If same are created, the application shall be denied.

5. The lot line adjustment, if approved by the city manager or designee, shall not be effective until the applicant records the surveyor's affidavit in the public records of Alachua County.

(Ord. No. 211359, § 2, 10-17-22; Ord. No. 2023-169, § 2, 6-1-23)

Sec. 30-3.35. Single lot replatting.

A. *Purpose.* The purpose of this section is to establish an abbreviated process by which existing (improved) subdivision lots may be replatted without going through the standard process of platting or replatting subdivisions.

B. *Applicability.* Individual lots shown on recorded plats that depict easements or front, side, or rear building setback lines may be replatted under this section. The lot shall be improved (building or structure) and there shall be an encroachment upon one or more of the building setback lines or easements indicated on the recorded plat.

C. *Review.*

1. *Application.* An application, on a form prescribed by the city, shall be completed and submitted together with the following:

a. The proposed (final) plat of the lot. The record plat should be signed by all lot owners of record and mortgagees, if any.

b. A survey of the lot and improvements certified by a professional land surveyor registered in the state according to F.S. Ch. 472. The survey should be drawn and submitted on a drawing no less than 11 inches by 17 inches in size.

c. Copies of the existing recorded subdivision.

d. Title evidence that conforms to the requirements of F.S. § 177.041.

e. Taxes paid receipt.

f. Formal consent of the requisite number of owners of properties within the subdivision or from the authorized representative of the homeowners association of the subdivision or other authorized entity or individual affixed to or attached to the linen or film that will be recorded in the public records.

g. In the event there is an encroachment over, under, upon or through an easement, the release or extinguishment of the easement from applicable utilities.

h. An opinion from an attorney addressed to the City of Gainesville that the homeowners association, entity, or owners of property have the authority to amend the restrictions, plat lines, easements, as applicable, and that the consent has been properly executed by the appropriate parties.

2. Upon receipt of a completed application, the several departments of the city shall review and provide comment.

3. Upon the adoption of a resolution approving the replat of the single lot, the original linen or stable base film drawing of the replat shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court. It shall be recorded by the property owner requesting replat with all fees paid by that owner. Upon recording the replat, copies shall be submitted to the city in the form prescribed by the city.

Sec. 30-3.36. Minor subdivisions.

A. *Minor subdivision standards.*

1. Each proposed lot shall conform to the provisions of this chapter.

2. All existing principal and accessory structures on each lot must conform to the use and development standards of this chapter.

3. All lots have city water and sewer services available and constructed to the lot line of at least one lot, with appropriate easements granted to allow future water and sewer connections to each of the lots at the time each lot is developed.

4. If the proposed minor subdivision abuts a public right-of-way that does not conform to the provisions of section 30-6.6 B., as further specified in the Design Manual, the owner may be required to dedicate, at no cost to the city, one-half of the right-of-way width necessary to meet the minimum design requirements. If the proposed minor subdivision abuts both sides of a substandard street, one-half of the right-of-way width necessary to meet those minimum design requirements may be required from each side. The dedication of this right-of-way or any easements necessary must be accomplished by a separate document. The applicant shall provide the city with legal descriptions of all easements or rights-of-way to be dedicated, and the city shall prepare and record the necessary documents as part of the approval process.

5. Each lot in the minor subdivision must front for the entire required minimum lot width on a public street or an approved private street, except in minor subdivisions where the lots are organized around a centrally-located common greenspace and individual owners are provided legal rights to ingress and egress to a public street or an approved private street. Where there is no minimum lot width requirement, each lot must abut a public street or approved private street for a width equivalent to the maximum driveway width required in section 30-6.20, plus any required turning radii area. Notwithstanding the above, the length of street frontage may be modified during minor subdivision review by the city manager or designee, based on the need to achieve the most efficient lot layout, access to and from the minor subdivision, operational needs of service vehicles, vehicular circulation and the health, welfare, and safety of the public.

6. The minor subdivision must create vehicular and pedestrian access to serve the minor subdivision and improve gridded connectivity by connecting to surrounding existing streets and by including new streets within the minor subdivision so that the resulting blocks will not exceed a maximum block perimeter of 2,000 feet or the maximum perimeter set by the zoning district, whichever is less. Modifications to this requirement may be granted by the city manager or designee where the construction of a street is limited by existing conditions such as, but not limited to:

a. Access management standards;

b. Regulated environmental features; or

c. Public facilities, such as, but not limited to, stormwater facilities, parks, or schools.

Alternatively, where the development review director determines that it is not possible to construct the streets that would be required to meet the block perimeter standard, the block perimeter must be completed with the provision of pedestrian and bicycle paths or multi-use paths. The applicant shall, at the expense of the applicant, construct the required streets or paths according to the appropriate city standards as determined through the minor subdivision review process, but may be sited and configured in a manner so that the streets provide the most appropriate access to the minor subdivision and connectivity to the surrounding street network. Where a street or path is planned to provide a future connection to a street or path beyond the extent of the minor subdivision, the applicant shall provide for the connection of the street by stubbing out the road improvements as close as practicable to the boundary of the minor subdivision.

7. Each approved private street must meet the following requirements in addition to the requirements in section 30-6.8:

a. An approved private street must be paved to a minimum width of 12 feet wide for one-directional traffic flow and 18 feet wide for two-directional traffic flow. Alternatively, a determination must be made by the city public works department, the city fire rescue department, and city solid waste department that the approved private street is adequate to support service vehicles as necessary to provide municipal services.

b. The structure and sub-base of the approved private street must meet the standards set forth in the Design Manual.

c. Each approved private street must be connected directly to a public street or to another approved private street. The method and type of connection will be subject to approval by the city public works department in accordance with the standards set forth in the Design Manual. The private street serving the minor subdivision must have a maximum length of 1,000 feet (measured by traversing the length of the approved private street from its farthest extent to the nearest public street). At the point the private street reaches 1,000 feet in length, the applicant shall provide one of the following, as determined by the city fire rescue department: appropriate emergency connection to the nearest public road, if such a connection can be made on property within the minor subdivision; or a turnaround sized to accommodate fire and rescue vehicles.

d. The owners of each approved private street shall provide necessary easements to the city for the purpose of providing municipal services. Alternatively, if the city finds the street serves a valid public purpose, the owners may gratuitously dedicate an approved private street for purposes of public right-of-way.

e. Lots created on an approved private street must be designed to minimize the number of curb cuts onto the street. Shared driveway access is required of adjoining lots, except where an odd number of lots are created, in which case, one lot, as determined by the city public works department, may be allowed to have a separate driveway.

8. All proposed minor subdivisions must meet the level of service standards in the Comprehensive Plan. Proof of meeting these standards shall exist in the form of a certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation. The approval of a nonresidential minor subdivision in no way reserves capacity for the purposes of concurrency.

B. *Review.*

1. *Application.* After a mandatory pre-application conference with staff, an application must be completed on a form prescribed by the city and submitted together with the following:

a. A map of boundary survey and minor subdivision certified by a professional land surveyor registered in the state according to F.S. Ch. 472. The survey must be drawn on a 24-inch by 36-inch linen or stable base film with a three-inch margin on the left for binding, and a one-half-inch margin on the other three sides. Additional information to be shown on the survey must include but not be limited to:

i. The lot lines, dimensions, legal descriptions and acreages for each lot being created.

ii. The acreage of the total tract.

iii. A vicinity map showing the location of the survey in relationship to major thoroughfares.

iv. A note stating, "THIS IS NOT A RECORD PLAT."

v. A municipal approval statement, to be signed by the director of planning and development services, director of public works and general manager for Gainesville Regional Utilities or their designee, certifying that the minor subdivision conforms to all applicable ordinances and regulations of the city.

vi. A statement to be signed by the clerk of the court, stating, "Received and filed as an unrecorded map in accordance with F.S. § 177.132."

vii. The minor subdivision book and page where the survey is to be filed.

viii. The exact location of all existing principal and accessory structures on each lot. If the existing structures obscure the alignment of the proposed lots they may be left off the map of minor subdivision and be submitted separately on a boundary survey of the parent parcel. Any shared use of said structures must be clearly stated and shown as easements on the minor subdivision.

b. A statement indicating the location where water or sanitary sewer service is available to the property, and a statement indicating that all utility service must be installed beneath the surface of the ground in accordance with section 30-8.2, and a statement indicating where stormwater management facilities are available to accommodate stormwater runoff of the proposed development.

c. If located on an approved private street, a signed consent (on the form provided by the city) from the owners of each approved private street that serves the minor subdivision.

d. Payment of fees as required by appendix A.

2. Upon receipt of a completed application, the several departments of the city shall review and provide comment.

3. Minor subdivisions that require any street, sidewalk, bikeway, bridge, drainage facility, screening wall or any other improvement required under this chapter may receive conditional approval but will not receive final approval or be filed with the clerk of the circuit court until all required improvements are fully constructed and approved by the city. No building permits may be issued for any of the lots until final approval is granted and the minor subdivision is filed.

4. If the proposed minor subdivision meets the conditions of this section and otherwise complies with all applicable laws and ordinances, the development review director shall approve the minor subdivision.

5. Upon approval of the minor subdivision, the subdivider shall file with the clerk of the circuit court, with all fees paid by the subdivider, the original linen or stable base film drawing of the survey and any covenants, deed restrictions, or other required documents as an unrecorded map, in accordance with F.S. § 177.132. Upon filing of the approved minor subdivision, the subdivider shall submit to the city, in the form prescribed by the city, copies of the filed minor subdivision and any required documents.

(Ord. No. 170831, § 1, 4-5-18; Ord. No. 200722, § 6, 4-21-22; Ord. No. 211359, § 3, 10-17-22; Ord. No. 2023-169, § 3, 6-1-23; Ord. No. 2024-263, § 2, 10-3-24)

A. *Requirements.* To effectuate the purpose of this article, every subdivision of land within the city shall be made in accordance with the requirements specified in this article. Such requirements include a pre-application conference; obtaining design plat approval; obtaining construction plan approval; obtaining final plat approval; constructing required public improvements; and supplying security for the construction and maintenance of such improvements. Proposed residential subdivisions shall meet the level of service standards adopted in the Comprehensive Plan. Proof of meeting these standards shall exist in the form of a certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary or final concurrency (as applicable at the particular review stage), or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation.

B. *Pre-application conference.*

1. *Required.* Prior to the preparation of a design plat, the subdivider shall seek the advice of city staff to become familiar with the subdivision requirements, city policies and provisions of the Comprehensive Plan. The subdivider is encouraged to bring plans and data specified in this section so as to clearly show existing conditions of the site and its vicinity and the proposed layout of the subdivision. It is intended that the procedure will assist the subdivider in preparing a plat that will meet the requirements of this article. This procedure does not require a formal application or fee.

2. *Prohibited or discouraged designs or improvements.* As indicated in this article and further referenced in the Design Manual, certain practices, designs or improvements are discouraged or prohibited. If prohibited, a modification will be required in order for the same to be allowed. If discouraged, the same may be allowed by the city commission depending on a proper showing of necessity and the infeasibility of requiring the preferred practices, designs or improvements when applied to the particular circumstances involved.

3. *Concept review (Sketch drawing).* The applicant may submit an application for the optional concept subdivision review by city staff, with a sketch that contains the following:

a. Approximate tract boundaries.

b. Approximate location with respect to section lines.

c. Streets on and adjacent to the tract.

d. Proposed general street layout.

e. Environmental features including but not limited to significant topographical and physical features, regulated surface waters and wetlands, regulated natural and archaeological resources, creeks, uplands, lakes, wetlands, FEMA and community determined flood plains, and heritage trees.

The board shall determine if the proposed subdivision is in conformity with the general goals and objectives of the city with respect to the Comprehensive Plan; the city's official roadway map; existing zoning requirements, including amendments thereto; policies and plans established by the city with respect to neighborhoods, lake levels, water supply, maintenance of the tree canopy levels identified in the Comprehensive Plan, control of invasive non-native plant species, protecting environmental features, provision for emergency access, consideration of pedestrian, bicycle and transit access and greenway connections, waste disposal and other essential utilities; the overall stormwater management plan including landscaping of stormwater management basins; and policies for development in any special improvement and redevelopment districts. Particular attention shall be given to the arrangement, location, and width of streets, the provision of high quality shade trees along the streets, their relation to the topography of the land, water supply, sewage disposal, stormwater management, lot sizes and arrangement, and the present or future development of abutting property.

c. The board may approve the design plat as presented if found to be in compliance, require modifications, or disapprove the plat. Approval of the design plat, subject to conditions, revisions and modifications as stipulated by the board, shall constitute conditional board approval of the subdivision as to the character and intensity of development and the general layout and approximate dimensions of streets, lots and other proposed features. If the design plat is disapproved, the Development Review Board shall indicate the reasons therefor.

8. *City commission review.*

a. Within 60 calendar days after development review board approval, the subdivider shall file with the city at least three copies of the design plat, including any modifications imposed by the development review board. If the subdivider does not file the design plat within the prescribed time period, no preliminary development order shall be issued unless an extension of time is requested in writing prior to the expiration of that period and is granted by the city commission. In granting an extension, the city commission may attach such other restrictions or conditions as the commission deems appropriate to serve the public interest. In the case of residential subdivisions, the city commission may vote to grant extensions for design plat review of up to six months only and only if the subdivider possesses a valid, unexpired certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation, as appropriate. Further extensions for city commission review of design plats for residential subdivisions shall require a new concurrency review.

b. The city commission shall review the recommended design plat and consider findings made by the development review board and staff. The city commission shall determine if the proposed subdivision is in conformity with the general goals and objectives of the city with respect to the Comprehensive Plan; existing zoning requirements, including all amendments thereto; policies and plans established by the city with respect to neighborhoods, lake levels, water supply, sustaining the urban forest, protecting environmental features, provision for emergency access, consideration of pedestrian, bicycle, vehicle, and transit access and greenway connections, waste disposal and other essential utilities; the overall stormwater management plan; and policies for development in any special improvement and redevelopment districts. Particular attention shall be given to the arrangement, location, function, and width of streets, their consistency with the goal of developing a multimodal transportation network and providing sufficient space for street trees both above and below ground, their interaction with the overall transportation system and relation to the topography of the land, water supply, sewage disposal, stormwater management, lot sizes and arrangement, and the present or future development of abutting property.

c. The commission may approve the design plat as presented if found to be in compliance, require modifications, or disapprove the design plat if it is not in compliance. If disapproved, the design plat shall be redesigned before resubmission for approval.

d. *Effect of approval.* Approval of the design plat by the city commission is a preliminary development order. It shall not constitute acceptance of a final plat but shall be deemed an expression of approval of the layout submitted as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. The preliminary development order and the associated design plat shall expire and be of no further effect 12 months from the date of approval unless either a timely final plat is filed for approval or the time is extended with appropriate conditions by the city commission prior to expiration; otherwise, the subdivider shall reapply for design plat approval in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In the case of residential subdivisions, the city commission may vote to grant extensions of up to six months only, and only if all the concurrency management requirements of this chapter can be met and if the extension would not be in conflict with any other ordinance of the city. The approval of nonresidential subdivisions in no way reserves capacity for the purposes of concurrency. This provision regarding the effect of approval and expiration of a design plat shall not be subject to a variance or otherwise superseded by any ordinance or regulation of the city.

D. *Construction plans.*

1. *Preparation.* Following city commission approval of the design plat, the subdivider shall submit construction plans and specifications for all subdivision improvements required in accordance with this article. The construction plans shall be prepared by an engineer registered in the state in conformance with this article, the Design Manual, and other applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

Plans for the proposed improvements and a boundary survey shall be required. The improvement plans shall show the proposed locations, sizes, types, grades, and general design features of each facility, and shall be based upon reliable field data. These drawings shall include, at a minimum, a topographic map, stormwater management plan, a landscape plan, an invasive exotic plant control plan, and construction drawings showing street profiles, street cross sections, and water supply, sewer and stormwater management as specified by the public works department and Gainesville Regional Utilities and all champion and heritage trees identified for preservation or removal, with protective barricades drawn to scale. The landscape plan shall show all buffers and stormwater management areas as well as the locations and specifications for street trees.

2. *Review.* The subdivider shall submit multiple sets of plans as necessary to facilitate review by the city in accordance with development review. The construction plans shall be approved if they are consistent with the approved design plat and comply with all standards and specifications. If the construction plans are not consistent with the design plat as approved by the city commission or do not comply with all standards and specifications, the city shall issue either:

a. Conditional approval, subject to any necessary modifications that shall be indicated on the plans or attached to them in writing; or

b. Disapproval of the construction plans or any portion thereof, indicating in writing the reasons for the disapproval. The subdivider shall be responsible for timely resubmittal of acceptable plans within 12 months from the date of approval of the preliminary development order.

E. *Final plat.*

1. *Generally.* The final plat shall conform to the design plat as approved by the city commission and shall incorporate all modifications and revisions specified in the approval, except shifts in stormwater and roadway facilities that do not change lot layout may deviate from the design plat with approval from the city manager or designee.

2. *Application.* After approval of the design plat and construction plans, the final plat and other information required in this section shall be submitted in the correct form as prescribed by the city. The following shall be submitted for the final plat review:

a. The original stable base film tracing of the final plat prepared in accordance with the requirements of this article, F.S. Ch. 177, and any other applicable statutes and ordinances.

b. A title opinion of an attorney at law licensed in Florida or a certification by an abstractor or title company as required by F.S. Ch. 177.

c. Applicable public improvement security documents.

d. An additional fee as set forth in appendix A to defray the expense of investigating, holding hearings and acting upon the final plat.

e. An additional fee as set forth in appendix A to defray the expenses of inspection of roadway and drainage facilities by the city manager or designee.

3. *Specifications.* The final plat shall be legibly drawn at a scale of at least one inch equals 100 feet using a sheet size of 24 inches by 36 inches, reserving a three-inch binding margin on the left-hand side and a one-inch margin on the other three sides. If more than one sheet is required, an index map relating each sheet to the entire subdivision shall be shown on the first sheet. The final plat shall be prepared by a land surveyor in accordance with and include all of the information required by F.S. Ch. 177. The final plat shall also contain:

a. The exact boundary line of the tract.

b. A vicinity map showing the location and acreage of the lands subdivided.

c. The location of all creeks, ponds, lakes, sinkholes, wetlands, and watercourses within the subdivided lands and any part of the lands within the flood channel or floodplain as shown on the city's flood control maps adopted pursuant to this chapter as of the date of final plat submission.

d. The front building setback line for each lot.

e. Any subdivision boundary that is within a half-mile radius of any horizontal geodetic control monument established by the county control densification survey or National Geodetic Survey Horizontal or Vertical Control Network bearing confirmed coordinate values related to the 1983 and the 1990 North American Datum Adjustment shall conform to the following requirements:

i. All final plats shall identify all horizontal and vertical geodetic control monuments as described above located within 500 feet of the proposed plat boundary.

ii. All plats shall have a minimum of three permanent reference monuments per 40 acres of platted subdivision, which shall have state plane coordinates established from the 1983 and the 1990 North American Datum Adjustment delineated on the plat and shall be tied directly to the plat boundaries.

iii. All plats shall have a minimum of two benchmarks located and described with the plat that shall be projected from North American Vertical Datum, 1988, or later.

iv. The basis of bearings for all plats shall be grid north as established from the county control densification survey and state plane coordinate system or National Geodetic Survey Horizontal Control Network.

v. The state plane coordinates and bearing basis shall be established by conducting a self-closing traverse between two horizontal geodetic control monuments. Each traverse shall meet or exceed third order class one standards of accuracy as described in the most recent version of the Standards and Specification for Geodetic Control Network (SSGCN), as set forth by the Federal Geodetic Control Committee. When a development contains multiple units, a major control traverse tied to two horizontal geodetic control monuments may be submitted with the first phase, with subsequent units being tied to this control traverse.

vi. A traverse sheet identifying the field angles, permanent reference points, distances and the adjustments shall be submitted on 8½-inch by 11-inch paper with the plat submitted for final development review. Copies of the field notes shall also be submitted. All documents shall be signed and sealed by a surveyor.

vii. All geodetic monuments, including traverse stations set for the county control densification survey, that fall within the limits of a development shall be shown on the development plan and construction plans. All geodetic monuments that are in danger of being disturbed or destroyed shall be referenced by a surveyor prior to the start of construction and reset by a surveyor after the construction is complete. If it is not practical to reset the geodetic monument in its original position, an off-set monument may, with the approval of the city manager or designee, be set. The referencing and resetting of a geodetic monument shall be in accordance with the specifications set forth in Article 2.1 of the SSGCN. Traverse stations shall require an accuracy of third order class one and primary stations and their Azimuth marks shall require second order class one accuracy standards. The surveyor who resets the geodetic monument shall be responsible for the preparation and submittal of all documents necessary for the notification of the state department of environmental protection, city engineer, the county property appraiser's office and any other appropriate government agency. Notification shall include, but not be limited to, a complete description of the geodetic monument with all its accessories, an accurate how-to-reach description, the date of last station recovery, the name of the person recovering monumentation, and the address of the recovery party. This work shall be performed prior to the final inspection and/or acceptance of the development.

viii. Any person who disturbs or destroys a geodetic monument shall be fully responsible for the expense of having the monument reset by a surveyor. The city may, at the expense of the person responsible for disturbing or destroying the monument, have a surveyor reset the geodetic monument in accordance with the specifications set forth in Article 2.1 of the SSGCN.

ix. For purposes of this section, a surveyor means a person who is registered to engage in the practice of surveying and mapping under F.S. Ch. 472.

4. *Review.*

a. *Staff review.* Prior to final plat approval, city staff and the city attorney's office shall review the proposed plat and supporting documents. If the proposed plat and supporting documents meet the technical requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws and ordinances, the departments shall approve the plat as to the requirements within their areas of responsibility.

b. *City commission review.* If the final plat is consistent with the design plat as approved by the city commission, meets all requirements of this chapter, and otherwise complies with all applicable laws and ordinances, it shall be forwarded to the city commission for final consideration. Upon approval, the final plat shall bear certification of the approval by the city clerk.

5. *Recording.* Upon approval of the final plat by the city commission, the original linen or stable base film tracing of the final plat, any required covenants or deed restrictions, and the declaration of condominium if the subdivision is a condominium development, shall be recorded with the clerk of the circuit court by the subdivider with all recording fees paid by the subdivider within 15 calendar days from the date the final plat has been returned to the subdivider by city staff. Recording the approved final plat shall constitute a final development order. Within 15 calendar days from the date of recording, three Mylar copies of the recorded plat and three paper copies of the recorded plat signed and sealed by the clerk of the circuit court shall be submitted to the city.

(Ord. No. 170831, § 2, 4-5-18; Ord. No. 211052, § 3, 6-16-22)

Sec. 30-3.38. Subdivision improvements.

Upon receipt of notice from the subdivider, the Directors of Public Works and Gainesville Regional Utilities will make an inspection of the construction work. If work is found to be satisfactorily completed, the city will accept the improvements for maintenance.

2. Acceptance for maintenance is intended to mean normal maintenance functions as routinely performed by the city. It shall not include removal of soil accumulations on streets caused by excessive erosion from adjacent lots, either prior to or during building construction within the subdivision. It shall not include damage to any improvements caused by private construction or private utility vehicles within the one-year maintenance period. All decisions regarding abnormal damage or maintenance shall be made by the public works department or Gainesville Regional Utilities.

Sec. 30-3.39. Security for subdivision improvements.

A. *Construction security.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, no final plat of any subdivision shall be approved by the city unless security is filed with the city to secure the construction and completion of the required subdivision improvements in a satisfactory manner within 12 months from the date of final plat approval. If the subdivider fails to construct and complete the required subdivision improvements within the required time frame, the city shall use the security to complete the required subdivision improvements. In determining the cost of the improvements for which security is required, improvements otherwise covered by a separate bond or security arrangement between the subdivider and the city and those improvements already constructed and approved by the director of public works shall not be included. The form of security shall be one of the following:

1. *Surety bond.* A surety bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state with a rating of not lower or less than A-XII as rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc., an independent national rating service for surety companies. The surety bond shall be enforceable by and payable to the city in a sum at least equal to 120 percent of the total cost of the required subdivision improvements provided in the subdivision as estimated by the subdivider's engineer and verified and approved by the directors of public works and Gainesville Regional Utilities. The surety bond shall be first approved by the city attorney as to form and legality prior to its submission with the proposed final plat to the city commission for approval and shall be executed by both the subdivider and the party or parties with whom the subdivider has contracted to perform the work and construct the improvements.

2. *Cash deposit.* A cash deposit with the city in the same amount that would be required for the surety bond, which cash shall be deposited with the director of management and budget of the city and held under the same conditions as are required in a surety bond. Such deposit will be held for the developer and, in the event of any nonperformance by the developer as required by the ordinances of the city, will be used by the city to complete the required subdivision improvements. During construction, upon the request of the subdivider, and upon inspection and approval of construction and costs thereof by the city, the city shall refund to the subdivider an amount equal to the approved costs for such improvements; provided, at no time shall the balance of the cash deposit with the city be reduced to less than 30 percent of the estimated costs of the subdivision improvements until all the subdivision improvements are completed and so certified to by the city. Interest earned on all such cash deposits with the city shall be for the account and to the credit of the person or persons making such deposit.

3. *Letter of credit.* Deposit with the city and place with the city manager or designee an irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit by a Florida bank. The letter of credit shall be for an amount equal to 120 percent of the estimated costs of the required subdivision improvements. The letter of credit shall remain with the city as a valid letter of credit until the city is satisfied that all construction of required subdivision improvements has been completed in accordance with plans and specifications and that all other provisions of this chapter relating thereto have been fully complied with.

4. *Construction loan agreement.*

a. Deposit with the city a construction loan agreement in the amount of at least 120 percent of the estimated cost of the required subdivision improvements, which agreement shall be entered into by a recognized lending institution with the subdivider for the benefit of and satisfactory to the city, providing that:

i. The lending institution will make payments on the proceeds of the loan to the city if the subdivision improvements are not completed and approved by the city within the time required;

ii. No payments of proceeds of the portion of the loan reserved for improvements shall be made to anyone until the city has approved the payment, which approval will be given if work is accomplished in accordance with approved plans and specifications and ordinances of the city; and

iii. At no time will the loan proceeds be expended by that lending institution in excess of 90 percent of the estimated costs of the required subdivision improvements until all the improvements are completed and so certified to by the city.

b. Deposit with the city a construction loan agreement in the amount of at least 100 percent of the estimated cost of the required subdivision improvements, which agreement otherwise meets the requirements of Subsection a. above, and an unconditional guaranty from the subdivider in the amount of at least 20 percent of the estimated cost of the required subdivision improvements that meets the following requirements:

i. Absolutely and unconditionally, jointly and severally, guarantees to the city the full and prompt payment of the amount set forth in the guaranty that will be used by the city to complete the required subdivision improvements, and the complete performance of the subdividers of all conditions and requirements to be performed by the subdivider under the City Code;

ii. Unconditionally, jointly and severally, agrees to pay all reasonable expenses and charges, legal fees and other fees (including attorney's fees and costs, including court costs at trial, appeal or bankruptcy proceeding) paid or incurred by the city in enforcing the unconditional guaranty;

iii. Jointly and severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the city, its elected and appointed officers, employees, and agents from any loss suffered or occasioned by the failure of the subdivider to satisfy its obligations to third parties arising out of the subdivision of the land;

iv. Binds the guarantors and their successors and assigns, and inures to the benefit of the city; and

v. Makes such other representations and warranties requested by the city manager or designee to protect the interests of the city.

5. *Combination.* Use a combination of the allowable security types as provided for in this section in order to reach the total of 120 percent of estimated costs of required subdivision improvements.

B. *Conditional final plat.*

1. In lieu of the security requirements of this section, the city commission may approve a conditional final plat, where approval of the plat is conditioned on the subdivider proceeding with installation of the required subdivision improvements and fully completing the improvements, in full accordance with approved plans and specifications and the ordinances of the city, within two years of the date of conditional final plat approval. The plat shall not be recorded, but shall be retained by the city clerk until the city manager shall have certified that all required subdivision improvements have been completed in accordance with approved plans and specifications and ordinances of the city and the same has been approved by the city commission. Upon certification by the city manager and upon proof by title insurance or other similar assurance to the satisfaction of the city that there are no liens or possibilities of liens on the subdivision improvements or on the property to be dedicated to the public, and that the dedicator has clear fee title thereto, the city shall approve the final plat and accept the dedication of the public right-of-way easements, and other dedicated portions as previously shown on the prior approved plat as set out in this chapter, and the subdivider shall record the plat and provide copies as specified in section 30-3.37.

2. No building permits shall be issued on property within the boundaries of the subdivision plat until the plat shall have been approved and accepted by the city commission and placed on record in the public records of the county.

3. During construction the subdivider may, upon the posting of a bond or other such security for the cost of the uncompleted improvements, have a prior conditional approval converted to final approval and acceptance provided that all other requirements and conditions of this chapter applicable to final plat acceptance have been met.

C. *Maintenance security.*

1. Under any arrangement for subdivision development within the city, the subdivider is obligated to the city for any necessary repair of all required subdivision improvements under the ordinances of the city for the period of one year following the date the city accepted the improvements for maintenance. During the one-year period, the subdivider shall provide the city with security in a form set forth in this section in an amount equal to 15 percent of the costs of the required subdivision improvements, which may be used by the city to pay the costs of any necessary repairs and maintenance on the subdivision improvements during the one-year period.

2. In those developments where lands and improvements remain under private common ownership, instruments relating to the use and maintenance of such areas and improvements shall be required. The city may require the establishment of an appropriate entity and the execution and recording of any appropriate legal instrument necessary to ensure the maintenance, protection, and preservation of common areas designated on the plat. The title to all land and improvements that are shown on the plat as common areas, private roads, etc., shall be held and continue to be held so as to ensure their proper maintenance and care and to permit and ensure their continued use as intended in the approved plat. The instruments shall include means legally enforceable by the city, the subdivider and his/her successors to guarantee payment of such sums of money as are necessary for the maintenance; and all conveyances or transfers of any interest in any of the property of the development shall be legally encumbered of record so as to guarantee the continued use of the common areas and roads as contemplated by the plat and the guarantee of the payment of the cost of the maintenance.

(Ord. No. 211052, § 4, 6-16-22)

Sec. 30-3.40. Enforcement.

A. *Generally.* No subdivision shall be made, platted or recorded, nor any building permit issued on subdivided lands, unless the subdivision meets all the requirements of this chapter and has been approved in accordance with the requirements provided in this chapter. The city or any aggrieved person may have recourse to such remedies in law and equity as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including injunctive relief to enjoin and restrain any person from violating the provisions of this chapter, and any rules and regulations adopted under this chapter.

B. *Building permits and certificates of occupancy.* No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any lot or parcel of land subject to the provisions of this chapter, except as follows:

1. If the lot or parcel is within a subdivision for which a final plat has been approved by the city commission and recorded and the required subdivision improvements have been installed and accepted for maintenance by the city, both a building permit and a certificate of occupancy may be issued.

2. If the lot or parcel is within a subdivision for which a final plat has been approved by the city commission and recorded and security for the required subdivision improvements has been provided by the developer in accordance with this division, a building permit may be issued, but no certificate of occupancy may be issued unless the city manager determines that all required subdivision improvements serving such lot or parcel have been satisfactorily completed and that reasonable ingress and egress can be provided to the lot or parcel and the remaining portions of the subdivision until all improvements are complete and the required maintenance security is received and approved.

3. If the lot or parcel is within a minor subdivision that has been approved by the director of planning and development services, city engineer, city traffic engineer and deputy manager for utilities (or their designees) in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

4. If the lot or parcel is part of a legal lot split that has been approved by the city manager or designee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

5. If the lot or parcel is a nonconforming lot, then as provided in article X.

C. *Violations.* Any person who, in connection with a subdivision of lands, shall do or authorize any clearing and grubbing, or shall lay out, construct, open, or dedicate any street, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main, or drainage structure, or shall erect any building or transfer title to any land or building, without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter, or who performs any of such actions contrary to the terms of an approved subdivision plat, or who otherwise violates this chapter, shall be guilty of an offense. Each day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.

#### DIVISION 8. RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATIONS

Sec. 30-3.41. Right-of-way vacations.

A. *Review procedures.*

1. *Application.* An application to vacate a public right-of-way may be submitted by either the city commission or by all the owners of land abutting the subject right-of-way.

2. *Board review.* Applications to vacate a public right-of-way shall be reviewed by the city plan board and the city commission according to the criteria provided in this section, with notice of the board hearings provided in accordance with law and this article. The city plan board's review shall be a recommendation to the city commission. Prior to the public hearing before the city plan board, the application shall be reviewed by city staff in accordance with the development plan review process as stated in this article.

B. *Review criteria.* Rights-of-way may only be vacated by the city commission upon its finding that the criteria in both subsections 1. and 2. as provided below have been met:

1. The public right-of-way no longer serves a public purpose and the vacation of the public right-of-way is in the public interest, which shall be based on a consideration of the following:

a. Whether the public benefits from the use of the subject right-of-way as part of the city street system;

b. Whether the proposed action is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan;

c. Whether the proposed vacation is consistent with the minimum block size requirements and other applicable street connectivity standards;

d. Whether the proposed action would deny access to private property;

e. The effect of the proposed action upon public safety;

f. The effect of the proposed action upon the safety of pedestrians and vehicular traffic;

g. The effect of the proposed action upon the provision of municipal services including, but not limited to, emergency service and waste removal;

h. The necessity to relocate utilities both public and private; and

i. The effect of the proposed action on the design and character of the area.

2. If the public right-of-way is an improved street, the city shall not vacate the right-of-way except if the following additional criteria are met:

a. The loss of the street will not foreclose reasonably foreseeable future bicycle/pedestrian use;

b. The loss of the street will not foreclose non-motorized access to adjacent land uses or transit stops;

c. For public right-of-way abutting any property located within the U4 through U9 transect zones or any property within a mixed-use zoning district, the loss of the street is necessary for development that includes the construction of a high density, mixed-use project containing both residential and non-residential uses or creating close proximity of residential and non-residential uses; and

d. There is no reasonably foreseeable need for any type of transportation corridor for the area.

C. *Vacation conditions.* The applicant shall pay all costs associated with relocating all public facilities, infrastructure, and utilities located within the vacated public right-of-way or as otherwise required by the vacation, and shall also compensate the city with fair market value for the property as may be applicable in accordance with the city's adopted policy for the disposition of real property.

#### DIVISION 9. DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW

Sec. 30-3.42. Purpose.

The purpose of this division is to promote harmonious, functional relationships among the various elements within any development such as the location of activities, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, and visual form. Development plan review is intended to permit maximum flexibility in reviewing each plan on its merits and encourage variety and innovation within the intent and purpose specified for each zoning district and the minimum requirements specified in the Code of Ordinances.

Sec. 30-3.43. Generally.

A. This division sets forth the application and review procedures required for obtaining development orders and certain types of permits. Development activity may be undertaken only when the activity is authorized by a final development order and any required development permits are issued by the city. A final development order shall be issued only when all applicable procedures, inspections, and reviews have been completed as provided in this chapter.

B. Development orders are transferable. However, so long as the land or structure or any portion thereof covered under the site development order continues to be used for the purposes for which it was issued, then no person (including successors and assigns of the person who obtained the site development order) may make use of the land except in accordance with the conditions and requirements of the site development order. The provisions of the site development order run with and burden the real property to which it relates until release or amended in accordance with formal action of the city.

Sec. 30-3.44. Exemptions.

The following development activities do not require development review under this article:

A. *Signs.* New signs and modifications or removal of existing signs that are authorized by a sign permit issued by the city.

B. *Removal of regulated trees.* The removal of regulated trees that is authorized by a tree removal permit issued by the city and is not associated with a development plan.

Sec. 30-3.45. Levels of development review.

All development requires rapid, intermediate, or major development review in accordance with the thresholds set forth in the table below. Any development activity below the thresholds identified for rapid review will be reviewed in conjunction with a building permit application. Development that includes components within different thresholds will be reviewed as one submittal in accordance with the highest threshold that is triggered by the development.

Sec. 30-3.46. Review criteria.

An application for a development plan or amendment to any previously approved development plan may be approved only if the application meets both of the following criteria:

A. The plan meets submittal requirements of the Land Development Code, including payment of fees, and complies with submittal schedules to provide adequate notice and review; and

B. The proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and complies with the Comprehensive Plan, the Land Development Code, and other applicable regulations.

Sec. 30-3.47. Review procedures.

A. *First-Step meeting.* Prior to filing an application for development plan review, the applicant shall attend a first-step meeting to discuss the development review process, code requirements, and to confer with staff about the development process. Comments made by staff at a first-step meeting are made solely for preliminary informational purposes and may not be construed as an approval or denial or agreement to approve or deny any development order.

B. *Application.* A completed application, on the form provided by the city, must be signed and notarized by all owners of the property and by any agents of the owners. Applicable fees, attachments, and other information as deemed necessary by the city must be submitted as part of the application. The city manager or designee shall determine completeness based on level of review required, the nature of the proposed development and other requirements as set forth in this chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, and other city requirements deemed necessary to provide a professional and complete review and evaluation of the application.

C. *Review.* If the application is determined to be complete, the application and associated materials will be reviewed by the applicable reviewing authority in accordance with the review criteria provided in this division, and the reviewing authority shall decide one of the following:

1. Find that all requirements of the review criteria provided in this division have been met and issue a final development order;

2. Find that all requirements of the review criteria provided in this division can be met with conditions specified in writing and issue a preliminary development order, which requires final review as provided in this section; or

3. Deny the application based upon a determination that the proposed development, even with reasonable modifications and conditions, does not meet the review criteria set forth in this division.

D. *Preliminary development orders.*

1. A preliminary development order must contain the following:

a. An approved development plan, with a listing of conditions and modifications, if required, in order for a final development order to be issued. The modifications must be described in sufficient detail and exactness to inform the applicant to amend the plan accordingly. However, the failure to list all requirements of this chapter and other regulations of the city will not relieve the applicant from complying with such requirements and regulations at the time of issuance of a final development order.

b. Notice that the preliminary development order does not constitute a final development order and that subsequently adopted ordinances, regulations, and laws may require additional amendments to the proposal.

c. An initial determination of concurrency.

2. A preliminary development order will be effective for six months from the date of approval. During this six-month period, the applicant shall seek final development approval. At the request of the applicant and for good cause shown, the reviewing authority may extend the period for obtaining final development order approval for a period of up to 12 months from the date of approval of the preliminary development order.

E. *Final development orders.*

1. A final development order must contain the following:

a. An approved development plan.

b. A certificate of final concurrency.

c. The expiration date for the final development order. A final development order will remain valid only if development commences and continues pursuant to an active building permit to completion with due diligence and in good faith according to the terms and conditions of approval.

2. A final development order will be effective for a period of one year from the date of approval unless otherwise specified in the order.

(Ord. No. 200722, § 8, 4-21-22)

Sec. 30-3.48. Amendments to approved development plans.

After a final development order has been issued, it shall be unlawful to change, modify, alter, or otherwise deviate from the terms or conditions of the order without first obtaining an amendment to the approved development order. Amendment of the development plan shall be made in accordance with the process for development review.

Sec. 30-3.49. Master plans.

A. *Purpose.* Master plan review is an optional step for projects that fall within the intermediate or major level of development review. A master plan is intended to provide for large area planning for phased developments. The intent of the master plan is to identify internal and external connectivity, regulated natural and archeological resources, and developable areas.

B. *Review and effect.* Master plans are reviewed by the technical review committee in accordance with the process set forth in this division for development plan review, and must demonstrate that the completed development will be consistent with this chapter and with the Comprehensive Plan. Each phase must include a proportionate share of any required recreational and open space, and other site and building amenities of the entire development, except that more than a proportionate share of the total amenities may be included in the earlier phases with corresponding reductions in the later phases. An approved master plan will serve as a basis for review of future development plans in the phased development, and individual phases or portions of the project must be consistent with the approved master plan.

C. *Expiration of master plan.* A master plan shall be effective for up to five years from the date of approval.

(Ord. No. 170974, § 2, 2-21-19)

Sec. 30-3.50. Concept review.

Concept review is optional for all intermediate and major development. Concept review is intended for the applicant to receive public input and city comments on a concept for development prior to the preparation of detailed plans and data and to alert an applicant to issues with, or objections to, a particular proposed development. Concept plans should address conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, zoning standards, site design, environmental concerns, concurrency, and transportation issues. The concept plan is reviewed by the technical review committee and by the appropriate reviewing board. Comments made by the technical review committee and the reviewing board during concept review are made solely for informational purposes and shall not be construed as an approval or denial or agreement to approve or deny a development order. The reviewing board shall issue no order, finding or other indication of approval or disapproval of the proposal.

Sec. 30-3.51. Affordable housing concept review.

Affordable housing concept review is encouraged for all certified affordable housing developments and is intended solely to assist affordable housing developers with meeting the application requirements for the State of Florida Housing Tax Credit program, in support of the state housing strategy stated at F.S. Ch. 420. The review will alert an applicant to problems with, or objections to, a particular proposed development. This concept plan shall address conformity with the Comprehensive Plan, zoning, environment concerns, and concurrency. The appropriate reviewing board may grant a non-binding conceptual approval. The conceptual approval does not grant to the applicant any development rights and does not represent a development order. This conceptual approval is only an indication that the development proposal appears to be consistent with general requirements for development approval and that a development order will only be granted after the requirements for a final development plan have been met.

#### DIVISION 10. BUILDING PERMIT AND CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY

Sec. 30-3.52. Building permit.

No building shall be constructed, reconstructed, altered, or extended unless a building permit has been issued indicating that the proposed use is in compliance with the provisions and regulations of this chapter; and there shall be no excavation, cut, or fill of earth or debris, no curb shall be cut or access opened onto a public street, no land shall be used for purposes other than agricultural, no signs shall be erected, and no building shall be moved unless all applicable required development permits have been obtained in accordance with this chapter.

Sec. 30-3.53. Certificate of occupancy.

B. *Review procedures.* All requests for modifications shall be submitted in writing with the application for development review on forms provided by the city. If an applicant requests multiple modifications, each modification shall be evaluated independently. The city manager or designee shall have the authority to approve the modifications specifically set forth in this section. The request shall be approved or denied during development plan review and, if approved, shall be noted on the final development plan. No administrative appeals are available for any decision to approve or deny a modification.

C. *Review criteria.* The city manager or designee may approve a modification if the request meets all of the following criteria:

1. The request is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and meets the intent of this chapter and the zoning district.

2. The applicant is providing a compensating enhancement of the public realm.

3. The request will not have a material negative impact on adjacent uses, and is not injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare.

D. *Available modifications.*

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **REQUESTED MODIFICATION** | **MIN. COMPENSATING ENHANCEMENT OF PUBLIC REALM** |
| Variation in required street setback up to 3 feet. | 1. 10% increase above required 1st floor glazing. |

Under no circumstances may a variance be granted to allow a use not permitted generally or by special use permit in the district involved, or any use expressly or by necessary implication prohibited in the district by the terms of this chapter.

C. *Review criteria.* A variance from the terms of this chapter or building chapters shall not be granted unless the appropriate reviewing board affirmatively finds that each of the following criteria have been met:

1. Special conditions and circumstances exist that are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and that are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.

2. The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action of the applicant.

3. Granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this section to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.

4. Literal enforcement of the provisions of the Land Development Code or building chapters would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of the Land Development Code or building chapters.

5. The variance requested is the minimum variance required to make possible the reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.

6. The variance is in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the regulation at issue and the Land Development Code, and such variance will not be injurious to the abutting lands or to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

D. *Prohibited considerations.* The following factors shall not be considered in any variance request:

1. The presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or adjoining districts.

2. Financial loss or business competition.

3. Whether the property was purchased with the intent to develop or improve the property, whether or not it was known at the time of purchase that such development would be a violation.

E. *Review procedures.*

1. *Pre-application meeting.* A pre-application meeting is not required; however, the applicant is encouraged to attend a meeting with staff to review procedural and regulatory requirements.

F. *Conditions and limitations.* In granting any variance, the board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the Land Development Code or building chapters. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and punishable according to applicable law. If a variance request is denied, the same variance may not be considered for the property for a period of two years from the date of denial.

G. *Expiration.* Any variance granted shall expire one year after the date of variance approval, unless a building permit based upon and incorporating the variance is issued within the aforesaid one-year period and construction has begun thereunder.

4. The matter shall be set for a public hearing within 50 calendar days of the date of the notice of appeal. This period may be extended by agreement of the city and all parties appealing the decision.

a. A departure from the essential requirements of law is something more than mere legal error. A decision made according to the form of the applicable law and the rules prescribed for rendering it, although it may be erroneous in its conclusion as applied to the facts, is not an act that amounts to a departure from the essential requirements of law.

b. The hearing officer shall examine the seriousness of any error and exercise discretion only when there has been a violation of a clearly established principle of law that results in a miscarriage of justice.

3. The reviewing board's decision was supported by competent substantial evidence.

a. Competent substantial evidence means such evidence that may establish a substantial basis from which the fact at issue can be reasonably inferred, or material and relevant evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The opinions and recommendations of experts, including city staff, are deemed expert testimony and constitute competent substantial evidence. Citizen testimony during any public comment portion of a hearing may constitute competent substantial evidence if it is fact-based and not a mere generalized statement of support or opposition.

b. The hearing officer may not reweigh the evidence or substitute his or her judgment for that of the reviewing board, but rather shall rule upon only whether the reviewing board's decision was supported by any competent substantial evidence.

If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the zoning map.

7. *Bisecting lines.* Boundaries that approximately bisect a block, lot or tract shall be construed to follow the median lines of such blocks as indicated by rear property lines or as measured between the centerlines of boundary streets in the absence of rear property lines or, in the absence of both of the above, by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map.

D. *Parcels divided by district boundaries.* Where any parcel of land is divided into two or more zoning districts or transects, the regulations of each individual district apply to that part of the parcel so zoned, except that the permitted density of development may be averaged over the entire parcel.

E. *Unzoned property generally.* If property in newly annexed territory is unzoned; or if the zoning of any property is vacated or invalidated for any reason, either judicially or legislatively, then the classification of any of such properties shall be deemed to be conservation district (CON), unless and until a different zoning is provided for such property by ordinance amending the zoning map; and, until such amendment is provided for, no use may be made of any such property except in accordance with the regulations for the CON district.

(Ord. No. 170974, § 4, 2-21-19)

Sec. 30-4.4. Annexed territory.

When lands are annexed into the city, such lands shall be rezoned in accordance with this chapter to an appropriate city zoning district(s). The county zoning district and applicable regulations shall apply prior to rezoning to a city zoning district.

Sec. 30-4.5. Interpretation of uses.

Any use that is not permitted by right, special use permit, or as an accessory use in a zoning district shall be prohibited in such district. In any case where the city manager or designee interprets whether a particular proposed or existing use is in fact a use that is permitted by right, special use permit, or as an accessory use in a particular zoning district, the city manager or designee may consider factors including but not limited to the following:

A. Hours of operation (including hours for service and deliveries);

B. Building and site arrangement relative to the neighboring permitted uses;

C. Types of vehicles used and parking requirements;

D. The number of vehicle trips generated; and

E. Whether the activity is likely to be found independent of the other activities on the site.

Sec. 30-4.6. Utility uses.

The following utility uses shall be allowed as permitted uses in all zoning districts:

A. Electric, cable, or fiber optic facilities.

1. All underground transmission facilities;

2. All overhead utility transmission facilities not exceeding three feet in diameter and 75 feet in height;

3. All transformers, meters and associated appurtenances; and

4. Any electric structure or facility that is sited on property 10,000 square feet or less and no more than 20 feet in height (utility poles, light poles and telemetry towers shall not be considered a structure).

B. *Water facilities.* All water mains, valves, hydrants, services, backflow preventers or any other appurtenances required to distribute and deliver potable water and to satisfy fire safety requirements.

C. *Wastewater facilities.*

1. All underground wastewater collection facilities including gravity sewers, force mains, service laterals, manholes, valves or other appurtenances required to collect wastewater; and

2. Any lift station or similar structure that is sited on property 10,000 square feet or less with a structure height of 20 feet or less.

D. *Gas facilities.*

1. All gas distribution facilities including gas mains, valves, services, meters or any other appurtenances required to distribute and deliver natural or LP gas; and

2. Any gate station, regulator station or similar structure that is sited on property 5,625 square feet or less with a structure height of 20 feet or less.

E. *Chilled water.*

1. All distribution facilities including mains, valves, services, meters or any other appurtenances required to distribute and deliver chilled water; and

2. Chiller plants consistent with the screening and design requirements of article VI.

F. Utility uses exceeding the above requirements shall require PS zoning and special use permit approval.

Sec. 30-4.7. Phasing.

Development phases shall be required to meet code independently from other phases. No phase shall be dependent on the completion of subsequent phases to be consistent with any required approvals and/or conditions, including but not limited to setbacks, building frontage, and building placement, configuration, function and design. The required landscaping and parking improvements shall be provided within each phase.

Sec. 30-4.8. Development compatibility.

A. *Setbacks.*

1. Whenever a zero foot setback is allowed in a zoning district, it may only be used if the abutting property is within a district that allows the same setback.

2. The minimum required side and rear setback for nonresidential buildings located on property abutting a single-family zoning district or the U1 district shall be the same as the setback required on the adjacent residential lot or as determined by the required buffer, whichever is greater.

B. *Limitations on uses.* All industrial or commercial activity and uses, except storage of equipment and parking, shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings when located within 300 feet of any property that is in a single-family zoning district or the U1 district.

C. *Building height and massing.*

D. *Multi-family developments.*

1. *Generally.* Multi-family development shall contain no more than six dwelling units per building and shall be in the form of single-family dwellings, attached dwellings, or small-scale multi-family when located within 100 feet of any property that is in a single-family zoning district, the U1 district, or a designated historic district.

2. *Abutting single-family property.* All new multi-family projects, whether stand alone or part of a mixed-use project, abutting property in a residential district or a planned development district with predominantly residential uses shall comply with the following regulations:

a. There shall be no outdoor recreation areas or uses allowed within any required building setback area or landscape buffer between abutting multi-family development and single-family designated properties.

b. Active recreation areas (including swimming pools, tennis courts, basketball, and volleyball courts) shall be located away from abutting single-family designated properties and shall be oriented in the development to minimize noise impacts on single-family designated properties.

c. There shall be no car washing areas, dumpsters, recycling bins, or other trash/waste disposal facilities placed in the required setback area between multi-family development and properties zoned for single-family use.

d. Parking lots and driveways located in the area between multi-family and abutting single-family designated properties shall be limited to a single-loaded row of parking and a two-way driveway.

e. A decorative masonry wall (or equivalent material in noise attenuation and visual screening) with a minimum height of six feet and a maximum height of eight feet plus a Type B landscape buffer shall separate multi-family residential development from properties designated single-family residential. However, driveways, emergency vehicle access, or pedestrian/bicycle access may interrupt a continuous wall. If, in the professional judgment of city staff or other professional experts, masonry wall construction would damage or endanger significant trees or other natural features, the appropriate reviewing authority may authorize the use of a fence and/or additional landscape buffer area to substitute for the required masonry wall. There shall be no requirement for a masonry wall or equivalent if buildings are 200 or more feet from abutting single-family properties. In addition, the appropriate reviewing authority may allow an increased vegetative buffer and tree requirement to substitute for the required masonry wall.

f. The primary driveway access shall be on a collector or arterial street, if available. Secondary ingress/egress and emergency access may be on or from local streets.

3. *Bedroom limit.* Maximum number of bedrooms in multi-family developments located within the University of Florida Context Area.

a. Multi-family developments shall be limited to a maximum number of bedrooms based on the development's maximum residential density allowed by the zoning district multiplied by a 2.75 multiplier.

b. If additional density is approved through a special use permit, then the multiplier is applied to the total approved density inclusive of any additional units approved by special use permit.

c. The bedroom mix in the development (i.e., the number of units with a specific number of bedrooms) is not regulated by those provisions.

d. Developments with planned development (PD) zoning are not subject to the bedroom multiplier.

(Ord. No. 170974, § 5, 2-21-19; Ord. No. 211359, § 4, 10-17-22; Ord. No. 2023-169, § 4, 6-1-23)

Sec. 30-4.9. Development bonus system.

A. *Available bonuses.* In accordance with this section, development projects may be eligible for: 1) additional building stories and the corresponding increase in overall building height; and 2) increased residential density. The bonus may be approved based on the provision of certain development improvements that exceed the minimum standards of this article, as follows:

B. *Additional building stories/height.*

1. *Usable open space.* If a development provides onsite usable open space that is accessible to the public (minimum size of 20' × 20'), additional building square footage above the number of stories allowed by right (and up to the maximum allowed by bonus) may be provided according to the following formula:

Square feet of public open space X number of stories allowed by right = additional square feet. If the total additional square footage meets or exceeds 20% of the total development site, one additional story is available. If the total additional square footage meets or exceeds 30% of the total development site, two stories are available.

Developments receiving a height bonus must provide at least one form of open space from the figures and associated standards below:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Green** | ![30-4-9green.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| A green is an open space for unstructured recreation. Greens consist of lawns, trees, paths, benches, and open shelters, all informally arranged. |
| 1. Greens may be spatially defined by landscaping rather than building frontages. |
| 2. Greens must front on at least two streets. |
| **Square** | ![30-4-9Square.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| A square is an open space for recreation and civic purposes consisting of paths, lawns, and trees, all formally arranged. A square is spatially defined by abutting streets and building frontages. |
| 1. Squares shall be located at the intersections of important thoroughfares. |
| 2. Squares must front on at least 3 streets. |
| 3. Façades facing the square should have at least 40% of their first floor's primary façade in transparent windows. |
| **Plaza** | ![30-4-9Plaza.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| An open space for commercial and civic purposes consisting primarily of paved surfaces. A plaza is spatially defined by building frontages. |
| 1. Plazas should be located at the intersection of important streets. |
| 2. Plazas must front on at least one street. |
| 3. Façades facing the plaza should have at least 40% of their first floor's primary façade in transparent windows. |
| **Playground** | ![30-4-9Playground.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| A fenced open space designed and equipped for the recreation of children. |
| 1. Playgrounds shall be located within ¼ mil surrounding neighborhoods. |
| 2. Playgrounds may be freestanding or located within parks and greens. |
| **Pocket Plaza** | ![30-4-9PocketPlaza.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| A formal open space available for civic purposes and commercial activities. Pocket Plazas are typically hardscaped and include landscaping in lawns or permanent planters. |
| 1. Pocket plazas should be located on side streets. |
| 2. Pocket Plazas must front on at least one street. |
| 3. Pocket Plazas may be used to provide seating for outdoor cafes or similar publicly accessible gathering space. |
| **Promenade** | ![30-4-9-Promenade.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| A linear pedestrian open space between streets that extends through successive blocks. The space largely hardscaped and lined with trees at the edges. |
| 1. Promenades must be a minimum of 16' wide. |
| 2. Promenades may include outdoor seating or other similar public amenities. |

2. *Tree preservation.* If a development dedicates an area onsite to preserve one or more heritage trees, the additional building square footage above the number of stories allowed by right (and up to the maximum allowed by bonus) may be provided according to the following formula:

Square feet of tree preservation area X number of stories allowed by right = additional square feet. If the total additional square feet meets or exceeds 20 percent of the total development site, one additional story is available. If the total additional square footage meets or exceeds 30 percent of the total development site, two stories are available.

3. *Structured parking.* Within U9 and DT, up to two levels of parking that are constructed within a habitable building are not counted as stories for the purposes of calculating the total number of stories, provided the footprint of the parking structure falls within 75 percent to 100 percent of the footprint of the habitable floors directly above the parking levels.

4. *Transit support facilities.* If a development provides onsite facilities, beyond what otherwise is required, to serve existing or planned public transit, including but not limited to bus bays, super bus stops, bus stations, bus lanes, and park and ride lots, one bonus story is available.

5. *Undergrounding/relocating utility lines.* If a development undergrounds overhead utility lines beyond what otherwise is required, or relocates existing underground lines in order to facilitate the appropriate placement of street trees or buildings along streets, up to two stories are available for every street segment completed (from intersection to intersection); one story is available for the undergrounding/relocation of utilities along the street frontage of the development.

C. *Increased residential density.*

1. *Tree preservation.*

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RESIDENTIAL DENSITY BONUS** | | | | |
| High Quality Heritage Tree Preservation (fair or better condition): | | | | |
| Tree DBH | 20"—30" | 31"—50" | 51"—70" | 71"+ |
| Bonus DU/Acre | 0.5 | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| Regulated Tree Cluster Preservation (fair or better condition): | | | | |
| Number of trees in cluster | 3—5 | 6—8 | 9—11 | 12+ |
| Bonus DU/Acre | 0.5 | 1 | 5 | 10 |

The city manager or designee may grant a density bonus for preserving tree clusters that, in his or her discretion, reasonably meet the following standards:

a. Species within the cluster must be on the Gainesville Tree List.

b. Trees within a cluster must have a minimum average DBH of 8 inches.

c. Trees within a cluster must be sufficiently spaced as to not have overlapping root plates.

d. Laurel oaks, water oaks, slash pines, and loblolly pines may not be included as part of a cluster.

2. *Affordable housing.* The city manager or designee may grant a density bonus for the provision of affordable housing units or payment-in-lieu in accordance with division 6 of article IV of this chapter.

D. *Review and approval.* Each request for a bonus is subject to the approval of the city manager or designee, based on the criteria outlined above in this section.

E. *Maximum allowable density bonuses.* The total density bonuses available to a development may not exceed a 50 percent increase over applicable available density by right.

Editor's note(s)—Ord. No. 170971, § 1, adopted February 21, 2019, amended § 30-4.9 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former § 30-4.9, pertained to building height bonus system. See Code Comparative Table for complete derivation.

Sec. 30-4.10. Reserved.

Ord. No. 2023-905, § 2, adopted December 14, 2023, repealed § 30-4.10, which pertained to occupancy limitation and derived from Ord. No. 2023-169, § 5, 6-1-23.

#### DIVISION 2. TRANSECTS

Sec. 30-4.11. Generally.

A. *Intent.* The intent of this division is to establish development standards that will encourage a more efficient and sustainable urban form by allowing a range of housing, employment, shopping and recreation choices and opportunities in a compact, pedestrian-friendly environment.

B. *Transects.* A transect is a geographical cross-section of a region that reveals a sequence of environments that ranges from rural to urban. Using the transect to regulate development ensures that a community offers a full diversity of development types, and that each has appropriate characteristics for its location. There are typically six transects organizing the components of place-making: Natural zone, rural zone, urban neighborhood zone, general urban zone, urban center zone, and urban core. This code assigns transects that are tailored to the unique character of the City of Gainesville. The allowable uses, dimensional standards, and development requirements for these zones are described within this division.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | **ZONE DESCRIPTION** | **INTENDED SITE LAYOUT** |
| ![30-4-11UrbZ1.png](data:image/png;base64...) | **Urban Zone 1** Consists of predominantly low to medium density residential areas, adjacent to higher intensity zones where neighborhood services and mixed use are permitted. | ![30-4-11edge.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| Buildings typically occupy the center of the lot with setbacks on all sides. The front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings. |
| ![30-4-11UrbZ2.png](data:image/png;base64...) | **Urban Zones 2 - 5** Consists of a wide range of residential building types. Higher number zones provide for the integration of offices and neighborhood services within an increasingly urban fabric. Setbacks and landscaping are variable. Streets with curbs and sidewalks define medium-sized blocks. | ![30-4-11Side-Front.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| Buildings typically occupy one side of the lot leaving a setback to the other side to allow for access or privacy. In many instances, the building occupies the entire lot frontage. A shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition. |
| ![30-4-11UrbZ6.png](data:image/png;base64...) | **Urban Zones 6 - 9** Consists of higher density mixed use buildings that accommodate retail, offices, and apartments. It has a tight network of streets, with wide sidewalks, steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the sidewalks. | ![30-4-11Front-Courtyard.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| The building typically occupies the full frontage, leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard. The continuous facade steadily defines the public street. In its residential form, this type is the attached dwelling. The rear yard can accommodate substantial parking. |
| ![30-4-11Downtown.png](data:image/png;base64...) | **Downtown** Consists of the highest density and height development, with the greatest variety of uses, and civic buildings of regional importance. Streets have steady street tree planting and buildings are set close to wide sidewalks. | ![30-4-11Front-Courtyard-a.png](data:image/png;base64...) |
| The building occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios. This is the most urban of types, as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public street. |

C. *Streets.* Within the transects, new developments shall connect to the existing street network. Where the existing street network is deficient with respect to gridded connectivity, the development shall provide new street connections to meet the block perimeter requirements.

The zoning map identifies a hierarchy of street types that determine the relationship of buildings to the street and the standards for the design of street landscaping and sidewalks. Street types include: Storefront, Principal, Thoroughfare, and Local Streets. All undesignated existing streets are assumed to be Local Streets. Below is a detailed description of the general function, character, and elements of each street type. Final street design for new development shall be in accordance with this article and the Design Manual, subject to review and approval by the city manager or designee in the development review process. In the event of a conflict between the standards in this article and the Design Manual, the Design Manual shall govern.

a. *Storefront.* Storefront streets are designed to encourage a high level of pedestrian activity. Higher intensity and density uses front this street type. Due to the level of pedestrian activity on this street type, minimum sidewalk widths are increased and first floor residential development requires a one and one-half foot elevation above grade (three feet recommended) for the privacy and comfort of residents. Building front entrances shall be oriented to this street type when there are multiple street frontages for the property.

![30-4-11C-a.png](data:image/png;base64...)

b. *Principal.* Principal streets include lower levels of pedestrian activity compared to storefront streets. This street type is located in mixed-use areas where the traffic volume is anticipated to be higher than on local streets. This street type allows for some auto-oriented uses with a special use permit.

![30-4-11C-b.png](data:image/png;base64...)

c. *Thoroughfares.* Thoroughfares are streets that carry high volumes of through traffic at higher speeds with less pedestrian activity and higher vehicular speeds than other street types. These streets are often fronted by larger scale commercial development and are usually four-lane or six-lane streets.

![30-4-11C-c.png](data:image/png;base64...)

d. *Local.* Local streets are intended to have slow speeds and provide for connections within neighborhoods and between residential areas and commercial areas. Local streets are not identified on the zoning map, but make up the vast majority of the street types within the transects. Any street that is not identified as a storefront, principal, or thoroughfare street should be assumed to be a local street.

![30-4-11C-d.png](data:image/png;base64...)

e. *Urban walkways.* Urban walkways are pedestrian/bicycle pathways that serve to improve pedestrian/bicycle connectivity, delineate blocks and provide for expanded pedestrian space. These may be established as alternatives to new streets in some locations.

![30-4-11C-e.png](data:image/png;base64...)

f. *Alleys.* Alleys are narrower streets that are primarily used for service access to developments, or vehicular access to rear parking areas. Alleys are encouraged to be preserved, improved, or established in conjunction with development.

![30-4-11C-f.png](data:image/png;base64...)

A. *Block standards.*

1. *Maximum block perimeter.* Maximum block perimeters are defined Table V-2 for each transect. When development cumulatively includes 50% or more of the total project area, it shall be required to include new local streets or urban walkways and the resulting block(s) shall not exceed the prescribed maximum block perimeter. Figure V-1 below depicts a recommended approach to breaking down large blocks to provide a new street grid on a large site.

**Figure V-1: Creating Blocks**

![FigV-1.png](data:image/png;base64...)

Step 1-original site; Step 2-introduce streets; Step 3-introduce alleys; Step 4-introduce lots.

2. *Construction of new streets.*

a. The required local streets or urban walkways shall be constructed at the expense of the owner/developer as part of the development review process and shall be constructed according to the appropriate city standards, but may be sited and configured in a manner so that they provide the most appropriate access to the development. Where a street is planned to continue beyond the extent of a development, the development shall provide for the continuation of the street by stubbing out the improvements as close as is practicable to edge of the property boundary.

b. The required local streets, multi-use paths or urban walkways shall provide for public access and may be dedicated for public right-of-way after construction, if the city desires to accept same for maintenance.

c. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, a development may receive final approval prior to construction of the required local streets or urban walkways if the city, upon approval of the city commission, has executed a binding agreement with the owner/developer that:

i. Requires the city and/or the community redevelopment agency to construct the required local streets as public streets within two years of final approval; and

ii. Provides for the conveyance or dedication of the associated right-of-way from the property owner to the city, at no cost to the city.

The city may enter into such an agreement only when the city determines that doing so would be in the public interest and when the city and/or the community redevelopment agency has budgeted legally available funds for the construction of the required local streets. The form and content of the agreement shall be provided by and acceptable to the city in its sole discretion.

d. Board modifications from the requirement to construct new streets may be granted in accordance with the procedures and criteria for a variance, with specific consideration given to situations where the construction of a street is limited by: access management standards, regulated environmental features, regulated natural or archeological resources, public stormwater facilities, existing utility facilities, contamination sites, inconsistencies with plans for a future city street network, parks, or schools. Where a variance from these requirements is approved, the block perimeter shall be completed with the provision of sidewalk and bicycle connections, and multi-use paths or urban walkways, subject to approval by the city.

3. *Urban walkways.* When required new streets or urban walkways are constructed as part of a subdivision or development, their design and construction shall conform to the following standards and applicable design manual standards:

a. New streets or urban walkways shall connect to existing streets on abutting properties, or be constructed in alignment with planned public streets on abutting properties.

b. Where a portion of a new street or urban walkway is newly constructed, it shall be designed to be extended to abutting property. Stub-outs shall extend to the property line.

c. Urban walkways shall be a minimum of 26 feet wide and may be designed with a single or divided paved pathway. The pathway(s) shall be at least ten feet wide in total width and shall provide for both bicycles and pedestrians. An urban walkway shall be landscaped with shade trees on minimum 50-foot centers on both sides of the paved path. Unpaved areas may also contain stormwater facilities. Urban walkways may contain benches, fountains, outdoor cafes or other outdoor uses as long as a minimum sidewalk width as specified above is maintained.

B. *Building frontage.* Building frontage requirements are intended to help frame the public realm by creating continuous building presence along streets.

1. The building frontage standards are a proportion of the building length relative to the width of the development site measured at the site frontage line, (see Figure V-3). Building frontage standards do not apply to new single-family dwelling construction.

**Figure V-3: Building Frontage**

![FigV-3.png](data:image/png;base64...)

2. *Frontage hierarchy.*

a. Where a development has frontage along multiple street types that do not include a thoroughfare, the urban street (storefront or principal, in that order of hierarchy) shall be considered the primary street for the front face of the building.

b. Where a development has frontage on a thoroughfare and any other street type, the thoroughfare shall be considered the primary street.

c. Where a development has frontage on two streets of equal type, then the city manager or designee shall make a determination as to which street frontage shall be considered primary.

**Figure V-4: Example of Gateway**

![FigV-4.png](data:image/png;base64...)

3. Outdoor seating areas, when located within the min/max street setback, may be counted towards meeting (up to 30%) the required building frontage requirements. Outdoor seating must be located behind a 3-4-foot screening wall that is integral and aligned with the front building facade. The wall must be architecturally consistent with the materials of the adjoining facade.

4. The appropriate reviewing board may consider alternative proposals for meeting building frontage requirements, including public art installations, innovative and unique landscape/hardscape improvements, or similar methods, which enhance the public realm and create a consistent urban form along the street.

5. A preserved high quality heritage tree canopy within the street setback range may count towards meeting the building frontage requirement.

6. The ground floor along the street frontages must contain active uses oriented to the street. Active uses may include, but are not limited to, display or floor areas for retail uses; waiting and seating areas for restaurants; atriums, lobbies, amenity areas, or dining areas for hotels or multi-family residential buildings; or ground floor offices. Active uses must be concentrated along storefront and principal designated streets. In the event that all of the abutting roadways are local streets, active ground floor uses must be concentrated along the most primary local street as determined by existing or anticipated pedestrian traffic.

7. In order to make ground floor commercial spaces viable and ready for operation, the owner/developer shall complete, prior to the issuance of any Certificate of Occupancy for the associated building or development, the installation of all mechanical, electrical plumbing, and fire protection infrastructure necessary for general tenant operability. The owner/developer shall also provide exhaust ventilation and grease interceptors during construction of the initial building shell. Grease interceptor size will be determined by GRU during the grease trap/interceptor permitting process and must provide adequate capacity to serve all prospective ground floor tenant spaces.

C. *Building placement and setbacks.* The placement of a building on a site is critical to creating a vital and coherent public realm. The building placement and setback standards shall shape the public realm and strengthen the physical and functional character of the area. Figure V-5 depicts the types of setbacks.

**Figure V-5: Building Setbacks**

![FigV-5.png](data:image/png;base64...)

1. Building placement requirements shall be measured from the back of curb instead of the front property line, with the following exceptions:

a. In the absence of curbs, shall be measured from the edge of pavement.

b. Where the required building placement falls within a public right-of-way, it shall be shifted to the property line instead.

2. Building placement requirements shall be comprised of a landscape zone, a public sidewalk zone and a building frontage zone. Figure V-6 depicts the required configuration of these zones in relation to the street curb and building. The required minimum widths for the landscape and sidewalks zones are listed within Table V-2. The building frontage zone shall be a minimum of five feet in all locations. Section 30-4.13 D. contains additional standards for the design of the building frontage zone.

**Figure V-6: Public Realm Zones**

![FigV-6.png](data:image/png;base64...)

3. Side and rear setbacks are minimums and shall be measured from shared property lines.

4. The following shall not be located within the public sidewalk zone; utility poles including electrical transmission and distribution poles; light poles; mechanical equipment as defined in section 30-6.10; signs included in section 30-9.2A; and street furniture including benches, trash receptacles, and bicycle racks.

5. Where multiple buildings are proposed within a development, the placement of buildings at the rear of a site is allowed as long as one or more buildings are placed along the front of the site meeting the building placement and setback and building frontage requirements of this division. Figure V-7 depicts the required configuration of multiple buildings on a site, such as within a shopping center. Streets or access drives shall be incorporated into the site to break it down into smaller lots/blocks (platting will not be required). The primary access drive shall be centered on the anchor building and shall be lined with buildings, which shall meet the required frontage standards along the street and access drive.

**Figure V-7: Multiple Buildings on a Site**

![FigV-7.png](data:image/png;base64...)

D. *Building frontage zone requirements.* All development shall provide a minimum five-foot wide building frontage zone behind the public sidewalk, and buildings shall have at least one type of building frontage incorporated into its design. Table V-3 contains the dimensional requirements for the various types of building frontages allowed. The intent of the building frontage zone is to provide a transition between the public street/sidewalk and the building. The type of activity conducted in the private frontage zone depends on the nature of the proposed use (Figure V-8). For a commercial building, the intent of the private frontage zone is to attract customers into the business. For a residential site, the intent of the private frontage zone is to provide for a private outdoor space and establish a separation from the public sidewalk for the ground floor rooms.

(Ord. No. 170831, § 4, 4-5-18; Ord. No. 170971, § 2, 2-21-19; Ord. No. 170974, § 6, 2-21-19; Ord. No. 200730, § 2, 2-17-22; Ord. No. 211359, § 7, 10-17-22; Ord. No. 2023-169, § 7, 6-1-23; Ord. No. 2022-679, § 4, 9-19-24; Ord. No. 2024-263, § 5, 10-3-24)

Sec. 30-4.14. Building design standards.

A. *Building massing.* Large building volumes must be divided to appear as smaller volumes grouped together. Volume breaks may be achieved by volume projections and recesses, and varying heights and roof lines. Therefore, building facades must not exceed 60 feet along a street frontage without providing a substantial volume break such as a volume projection or recess, a tower or bay, or an architecturally prominent public entrance. The recesses and projections must have a minimum depth and width of ten feet.

**Figure V-16: Building Massing**

![FigV-16.png](data:image/png;base64...)

B. *Facade articulation.* The standards contained in this section apply to multi-family, nonresidential and mixed-use buildings. Building facades along streets must maintain a pedestrian scale by integrating the following architectural elements:

![FigV-18.png](data:image/png;base64...)

1. Façades may not exceed 20 horizontal feet without including at least one of the following elements:

a. A window or door.

b. Awning, canopy or marquee.

c. An offset, column, reveal, void, projecting rib, band, cornice, or similar element with a minimum depth of six inches.

d. Arcade, gallery or stoop.

e. Complementary changes in façade materials or texture.

2. An expression line must be provided between the first and second stories delineating the transition between ground and upper floors.

3. Architectural treatments on the façade, such as cornices or expression lines, must be continued around the sides of the building visible from a street.

4. All building elevations (including secondary/interior side façades) must use similar materials and appearance as the front/street facade.

C. *Exterior building materials.* The following exterior material standards are required for each elevation of each building in any project that: (a) is multi-family residential or mixed-use projects that include both residential and nonresidential uses; (b) meets the threshold of either intermediate or major development plan review; or (c) is greater than two stories and is located on a storefront street, principal street, or thoroughfare street.

1. Exterior materials must be durable and weather-resistant and must be applied and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications or installation instructions.

2. Because the overall palette of materials should not be overly complex, each elevation must be limited to no more than three materials. The material for trim, fascia, mechanical penetrations, and other similar features may be excluded from this material limitation.

3. Exterior material classifications on each elevation must meet the percentages in Table X: Exterior Building Material Percentages. Interior elevations that do not face a public street or sidewalk are exempt from the requirements of Table X. Material percentage calculations are based on the elevation area for each individual elevation excluding window glazing or door areas.

a. *Class I:* Brick masonry; stone masonry; cast stone masonry; precast concrete-architectural finish; concrete-architectural finish; glass wall system; metal panel.

b. *Class II:* Stucco; fiber cement panel; fiber cement lap siding; manufactured stone; wood.

c. *Class III:* Concrete masonry unit-architectural finish; concrete masonry unit-unfinished; precast concrete-unfinished; concrete-unfinished; wood composite lap siding; EIFS (Exterior Insulation Finishing Systems); synthetic stucco.

**Table X: Exterior Building Material Percentages**

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development threshold | Class 1 % | Class II & III\*% |
| Intermediate project | 30 (min)—100 (max) | 0 (min)—70 (max) |
| Major project | 60 (min)—100 (max) | 0 (min)—40 (max) |

d. Class III materials may not constitute more than 30 percent of any building elevation. Unfinished concrete, precast concrete or concrete masonry units may not be used on any building elevation facing a public street or sidewalk. Exterior Insulation and Finish System (EIFS) may only be located at least 12-feet above ground level, measured from the base of the subject elevation.

4. The appropriate reviewing authority may allow modifications of exterior building material standards, including allowing the use of alternative materials not listed in Table X, considering the degree that the proposed substitute material is substantially similar in durability and longevity.

D. *Glazing requirements.*

1. Glazing percentages must be calculated as follows:

![FigV-17.png](data:image/png;base64...)

a. Nonresidential first floor: The area of glass between three feet and eight feet above finished floor, divided by the area of the building façade also between three feet and eight feet above finished floor.

b. Nonresidential above first floor: The combined area of glass on all floors above the first divided by the total area of the building façade for those floors.

c. Residential: The area of glass divided by the area of the façade.

2. The approving authority may allow reduced glazing and/or glass transmittance for places of religious assembly and schools.

3. There is no maximum limit on how much glazing may be provided. However, if glass walls are used, an architectural feature, such as a canopy/marquee, overhang, or a horizontal change in plane must be provided between the first and second floors to ensure pedestrian scale at the sidewalk level.

a. Protect watersheds, wilderness and scenic areas and conserve wildlife, as well as preserve open space.

b. Promote forestry, the growing of crops and grazing.

c. Provide for spacious developments.

d. Encourage the orderly expansion of urban development.

B. *Airport facility (AF).* See section 30-4.25.

C. *Conservation (CON).*

1. *Purpose.* The CON district is established for the purpose of conserving, restoring and protecting environmentally significant lands within the city and for establishing natural buffers between incompatible uses. It is intended that this district shall protect, restore and preserve natural features and open space so that the present and future residents of the city shall be able to enjoy the benefits of the natural environment of the city.

2. *Objectives.* The provisions of the CON district are intended to:

a. Conserve parks, recreational areas, open space, floodplains and unique natural features.

b. Protect and restore the natural features of the city, environmentally significant lands along creeks, wetlands, uplands and lakes, areas subject to detrimental erosion, and areas subject to noise disturbance due to aircraft-generated sound levels in close proximity to an airport or under a flight path.

c. Restrict the development of lands upon which a more intensive development would cause adverse environmental impact.

d. Provide the assurance of natural buffering between incompatible land uses.

D. *Educational services (ED).*

1. *Purpose.* The ED district is established to identify and locate public educational facilities at appropriate locations throughout the community.

2. *Objectives.* The provisions of the ED district are intended to locate such uses so as to provide easy accessibility and convenience to the users.

E. *Medical services (MD).*

1. *Purpose.* The MD district is established to provide adequate space in appropriate locations suitable for accommodating the health and related medical needs of the community.

2. *Objectives.* The provisions of the MD district are intended to:

a. Encourage such development to locate in close proximity to the community's major transportation arteries so as to provide maximum accessibility for emergency vehicles and the general public.

b. Discourage encroachment by unrelated retail and office activities and other incompatible uses.

c. Ensure through development plan review that development is undertaken in a manner compatible with less intense uses of land or buildings in the area.

F. *Planned development (PD).* See article III.

G. *Public Services and Operations (PS).*

1. *Purpose.* The public services and operations (PS) district is established for the purpose of identifying and providing suitable locations for the necessary public and private utility, public-private partnerships or other legal arrangements where the land title is vested in a government and the use(s) serves a public purpose, and recreation activities that serve and are used directly by the public for their own benefit and are necessary to the normal conduct of the community's activities. This district may be isolated and surrounded by any other zoning district compatible with the intended use of the facility.

2. *Objectives.* The provisions of the PS district are intended to:

a. Accommodate utilities, recreation and public facilities, at appropriate locations, necessary to serve the public.

b. Ensure public awareness of the location of existing or potential utilities, recreation and public facilities.

c. Ensure, by requiring development plan review where necessary, that such uses are designed to minimize negative impacts on surrounding properties.

3. *Additional requirements.* The following criteria shall apply to all uses within the PS district:

a. *Site design.*

i. Building scale and massing shall relate to that of adjacent buildings to the extent practical.

ii. Public developments shall be exemplary in their use of signage and landscaping and in the preservation of existing trees.

iii. Pedestrian areas shall be separated from vehicular areas wherever possible. Traffic circulation should be safe, convenient and designed according to sound engineering practices.

iv. The design of the site and facilities shall promote energy conservation through proper solar access, shading and other measures, where appropriate.

v. Appropriate access for emergency vehicles, garbage trucks and other service vehicles shall be provided.

vi. All site elements shall be designed to protect natural and community resources, such as wildlife habitats, historic structures and ecologically sensitive areas.

b. *External compatibility.*

i. Buffering and screening of public service facilities shall be provided commensurate with the facility's degree of impact and incompatibility with surrounding developments.

ii. Electrical transformers and other utility equipment shall be screened from public view.

iii. Site illumination and public address systems, particularly for recreation areas, shall be designed so as to create no interference with the privacy of adjoining properties.

iv. Adverse impacts on adjacent properties, such as noise, smoke, glare and odor, shall be mitigated through site design. Where necessary, building construction methods or mechanical equipment should also be used to mitigate these adverse impacts.

c. *Preliminary development plan in conjunction with rezoning.* When a property is rezoned to the PS district, the plan board shall recommend to the city commission whether a preliminary development plan is required before the property is rezoned or the uses permitted on the property are changed. The city commission may require such development plan, or those specific items or portions of a preliminary development plan that the city commission deems necessary, to be included as part of any petition to rezone property to this classification or to change the permitted uses on the property if the newly permitted use has not been previously approved. Should the city commission deem a preliminary development plan is needed to judge whether the proposed use can be accommodated on the site without detriment to the health, safety and general welfare of surrounding properties, the development plan shall meet the requirements of this chapter.

A preliminary development plan is intended to help further the purpose of this district by providing the plan board and city commission with additional information on site-specific conditions that will assist the city plan board and city commission in their decision-making process relating to the accommodation of the proposed use(s) at appropriate locations necessary to serve the public; the assurance of public awareness of the proposed location of potential public facilities, utilities and recreation; and the assurance that the conditions placed upon the rezoning are designed to minimize any potential negative impacts on surrounding properties.

(Ord. No. 170974, § 9, 2-21-19)

Sec. 30-4.25. Airport facility (AF).

A. *Purpose.* The airport facility (AF) district is established to ensure the proper and safe operation of the Gainesville Regional Airport, to protect the public investment in the airport, and to protect and promote the public utility of the airport. Recognizing the unique conditions pertaining to the airport, this district provides a means of balancing local concerns with conformance to applicable state and federal regulations.

B. *Objectives.* The provisions of the AF district are intended to:

1. Ensure public health, safety, and welfare by adherence to all applicable local, state, and federal standards and regulations.

2. Protect the public investment through development plan review, where applicable, to accommodate efficient and harmonious use of the facility.

3. Be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and be compatible with surrounding land uses through adoption and implementation of the airport facility zoning map.

C. *Additional requirements.*

1. *Airport facility zoning map.* The airport facility zoning map shall be adopted and amended by ordinance, and shall be processed in the same manner as an application for rezoning.

2. *Rezoning.*

a. Applications for rezoning to the AF district shall be accompanied by an airport facility zoning map as described herein, which shall become and be made a part of the ordinance rezoning the property. Additionally, the Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Authority (GACRAA) or city commission may require a development plan to be included as part of any petition to rezone property to this classification, provided GACRAA or city commission find that such a plan is essential to the orderly development of the airport and necessary to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the flying public and surrounding properties.

b. The petition shall be initially reviewed by GACRAA, and shall be primarily in the context of: The relationship of the proposed rezoning to the adopted airport master plan, the relationship and effect of the proposed rezoning to or on any existing land use on the airport, and the impact of the proposed rezoning on the airport. After such review, which shall be made within 60 calendar days of the filing of the application for rezoning, GACRAA shall submit a written recommendation to the city plan board as a permanent part of the public record. The application shall then continue to be processed as any other zoning map amendment petition under the procedures set forth in this Land Development Code. If a written recommendation is not made within the time provided, then the city plan board may act on the application.

c. The airport facility zoning map shall include, at a minimum, the following:

i. Scale, date, north arrow, and general location map showing the boundaries of the area for rezoning.

ii. Within the site and within 300 feet of the surrounding area, the location of all existing or proposed runways.

iii. All areas proposed for exemption from the parking or landscaping requirements.

3. *Development plan approval.* Development plan approval pursuant to this chapter shall be required for all development, except that GACRAA shall review any development plans within the AF district, excluding wireless communications facilities. Wireless communications facilities used exclusively for aeronautical purposes to serve the airport are subject to development plan approval by GACRAA. GACRAA shall specify any objections to the development plans and may make recommendations for modifications. In addition to the development plan review requirements of this chapter, GACRAA shall also review the development plan in the context of: The relationship and effect of the proposed development plan to or on the adopted airport master plan; the relationship and effect of the proposed development plan to or on any standard, rule, regulation, or applicable contractual agreements on the airport; and the impact of the proposed use on the airport. Upon completion of its review of a development plan, GACRAA shall either:

a. Find that all requirements have been met and issue a preliminary development order; or

b. Find that all requirements can be met with reasonable modifications that the developer proffers at the hearing and issue a preliminary development order; or

c. Refuse to issue a preliminary development order because the plan as presented fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, the Comprehensive Plan, or other federal, state, or regional laws and regulations as applicable.

4. *Parking.* Any development within the AF district shall comply with the parking requirements as set forth in this chapter, except GACRAA may waive or modify the off-street parking requirements during development plan review if GACRAA finds that the necessity or desirability of such parking is inappropriate due to the unique nature of the proposed use or the location upon the airport.

5. *Landscaping.* Any development within the AF district shall comply with the landscaping requirements as set forth in this chapter, except GACRAA may waive or modify the off-street parking requirements during development plan review if GACRAA finds that such landscaping is in conflict with Federal Aviation Administration safety requirements.

Sec. 30-4.26. Airport zoning overlay.

A. *Purpose.* The purpose of these airport zoning regulations is to provide both airspace protection and land use compatibility in relation to the normal operation of public-use airports located within the city. These regulations promote:

1. The maximum safety of residents and property within the areas surrounding the airport;

2. The maximum safety of aircraft arriving at and departing from the Gainesville Regional Airport and all public-use airports;

3. The full utility of the public-use airport;

4. Compatible development standards for land uses within the prescribed airport zones of influence associated with the normal operation of the airport;

5. Building/structure height standards for use within the airport zones of influence and other zones prescribed in the Federal Aviation Regulations; and

6. Proper enforcement of these regulations in compliance with state and federal laws in a manner that provides the greatest degree of safety, comfort, and well-being to both the users of the airport facility and the property owners within the vicinity of the airport.

B. *Findings.* The regulations set forth herein are adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by F.S. Ch. 333. It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity and also, if of the obstruction type, reduces the size of areas available for the taking off, maneuvering, or landing of aircraft, thus impairing or destroying the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. It is further found that certain activities and uses of land in the immediate vicinity of airports, as enumerated in F.S. § 333.03(2), are not compatible with normal airport operations and may, if not regulated, endanger the lives of the participants, adversely affect their health, or otherwise limit the accomplishment of normal activities. Accordingly, it is declared that:

1. The creation or establishment of an airport hazard that reduces the size of the areas available for such operations, or that inhibits the safe and efficient use of airspace or the airport, creates a public nuisance and injury to the city.

2. It is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare that the creation of airport hazards and incompatible use of land within the airport overlay district or the airport noise zones be prevented.

3. The creation or establishment of anything affecting the safety of aircraft or pilots or passengers, or that inhibits the safe operation of aircraft operating to or from the airport, shall be prevented.

4. The prevention of these hazards and incompatible land uses is desirable and should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by exercise of the police power, without compensation, in accordance with F.S. Ch. 333.

5. The prevention of the creation of airport hazards and incompatible land uses, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards, are public purposes for which the political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in land or air rights thereover.

E. *Airport zones of influence.* The City of Gainesville hereby adopts three airport zones of influence. The location of these airport zones of influence and their associated regulations are hereby established to protect the public safety and interest and ensure conformance with Code of Federal Regulations 14 CFR Part 77 and F.S. Ch. 333. Unless otherwise provided for herein, the boundaries of said zones and their associated regulations may only be amended by the City Commission of the City of Gainesville. Any application for land development within these airport zones of influence shall comply with these regulations, any applicable state or federal regulations, and any applicable requirements of the land development regulations of the City of Gainesville. The airport zones of influence established in these regulations include the following: 1) airport height notification zone; 2) airport runway protection zone; and 3) airport noise zone.

1. *Airport height notification zone.*

a. *Establishment.* The airport height notification zone is hereby established as an overlay zone on the adopted city zoning map. The airport height notification zone is established to regulate the height of structures and objects of natural growth in areas around the Gainesville Regional Airport. The airport height notification zone consists of two subzones, defined as follows:

i. *Airport height notification subzone 1:* The area surrounding the Gainesville Regional Airport extending outward 20,000 feet from the ends and each side of all active runways.

ii. *Airport height notification subzone 2:* The area within the city limits not within airport height notification subzone 1.

For the Gainesville Regional Airport, the boundary of the airport height notification zone established in these regulations is based on the runway configuration that is planned and documented as such in its approved airport layout plan.

The airport height notification zone map shall be adopted by ordinance. When future airport height notification zone maps are prepared, the city shall consider revisions to the boundary of the airport height notification zone and to these regulations. Any such revisions shall not be operative or effective for purposes of these regulations, until adopted by ordinance of the city.

In the event of a discrepancy between an airport height notification zone boundary as depicted on the map and as located by application of the definition of said boundary as set forth in these regulations, the boundary as prescribed by the latter shall prevail.

b. *Regulations.*

i. *Airport obstruction permit required.* Any person proposing to construct, alter, or allow an airport obstruction within an airport height notification zone or who receives a notice of potential airport obstruction as described in this section shall apply for an airport obstruction permit.

1) *Airport hazard.* A permit may not be issued if it would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard.

2) *Nonconforming obstruction.* A permit may not be issued if it would permit a nonconforming obstruction to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable airport zoning regulation was adopted that allowed the establishment or creation of the obstruction, or than it is when the application for a permit is made.

ii. *Notice of potential airport obstruction.* During the city's development review process, the city manager or designee shall issue a notice of potential airport obstruction to all applicants for development that the city manager or designee determines includes a "potential airport obstruction" and such applicants shall apply for an airport obstruction permit. For purposes of this section, development proposals shall be considered a "potential airport obstruction" if it would result in the construction or alteration of a structure or object of natural growth having a height that would exceed:

1) An imaginary surface extending outward and upward from the ends and sides of a runway at a slope of one foot vertically for every 100 feet horizontally, for a distance of 20,000 feet, in airport height notification subzone 1; or

2) Two hundred feet above ground level in airport height notification subzone 2.

iii. *Permit procedures.*

1) An airport obstruction permit applicant shall submit a completed application, as provided by the city, together with documentation showing both compliance with the federal requirement for notification of proposed construction or alteration and a valid aeronautical study.

2) Prior to any such permit request being scheduled for consideration by the city manager or designee, the applicant shall submit a copy of the final written determination, as issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) based on its review of the applicant's notice of proposed construction or alteration, in accordance with the provisions of 14 CFR Part 77.

3) Upon receipt of a complete application, the city shall provide a copy of the application to the Florida Department of Transportation's aviation office by certified mail, return receipt requested.

iv. *Permit criteria.*

1) *No airport obstruction.* If the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined it would not exceed any federal obstruction standard contained in 14 CFR Part 77, the city manager or designee shall grant an airport obstruction permit for the proposed development.

2) *Airport obstruction is an airport hazard.* If the FAA has reviewed a proposed development and determined that it includes an airport obstruction that constitutes an airport hazard, then no airport obstruction permit shall be granted by the city manager or designee.

3) *Airport obstruction is not an airport hazard.* If the FAA has reviewed a proposed land development and determined that it includes an airport obstruction that is not an airport hazard, then the city manager or designee shall not grant a permit based solely on such FAA determination but shall grant or deny an airport obstruction permit after considering the following criteria and in accordance with F.S. § 333.07:

(a) The safety of persons on the ground and in the air.

(b) The safe and efficient use of navigable airspace.

(c) The nature of the terrain and height of existing structures.

(d) The effect of the construction or alteration of an obstruction on the state licensing standards for a public-use airport contained in F.S. Ch. 330, and rules adopted thereunder.

(e) The character of existing and planned flight operations and development at public use airports within the city.

(f) Federal airways, visual flight rules, flyways and corridors, and instrument approaches as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration.

(g) The effect of the construction or alteration of an obstruction on the minimum descent altitude or the decision height at the affected airport.

(h) The cumulative effects on navigable airspace of all existing obstructions and all known proposed obstructions in the area.

(i) Any comments received from the Florida Department of Transportation.

4) *Permit conditions.* Any permit granted under this section shall include conditions that require the owner of the obstruction to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, marking, lighting and/or flagging as required by F.S. Ch. 333, Chapter 14-60, Florida Administrative Code, or by the FAA in its written determination. No airport obstruction permit shall be issued after the expiration date indicated on the FAA's written determination. Each airport obstruction permit issued shall specify a reasonable expiration date as a condition.

2. *Airport runway protection zone.*

a. *Establishment.* There is hereby established the airport runway protection zone as an airport zone of influence. The airport runway protection zone is established to regulate the uses of land lying in specified areas above which aircraft shall routinely operate at low altitudes and climb from or descend to the runways of the Gainesville Regional Airport. Within the airport runway protection zone, certain land uses are restricted or prohibited due to land use characteristics which could result in further death, injury, and property damage in the event of an aircraft accident, as such areas are more likely, statistically, to be exposed to accidents involving aircraft climbing from, or descending to, the runway at low altitudes.

The airport runway protection zone includes the area over which aircraft routinely operate at altitudes of 50 feet or less above the runway end elevation, and is defined as follows: that portion of the approach surface, as defined by 14 CFR Part 77.25, that extends outward from, and perpendicular to, its common boundary with the primary surface, as defined in 14 CFR Part 77.25, for a horizontal distance of: 1) 1,000 feet for utility/visual runways, 2) 1,700 feet for nonprecision instrument/other-than-utility runways, and 3) 2,500 feet for precision instrument runways.

The airport runway protection zone map shall be adopted by ordinance. in the event a discrepancy arises between an airport runway protection zone boundary as depicted on the map and an airport runway protection zone boundary located by application of the definition of said boundary as set forth in these regulations, the boundary as prescribed by the latter shall prevail.

b. *Regulations.* The following types of land uses shall be prohibited within the established airport runway protection zone:

i. Educational facilities (including all types of schools, pre-schools, and child-care facilities).

ii. Hospitals, medical, and health-related facilities.

iii. Places of religious assembly.

iv. Hotels and motels (including transient lodging, recreational vehicle, and mobile home parks).

v. Other similar land uses wherein or whereabouts persons are assembled.

Any use that is not prohibited in an airport runway protection zone, or otherwise deemed by the FAA as incompatible or a danger to persons on the ground, is allowable within such zone, subject to compliance with applicable airport noise and height notification zone and zoning district regulations.

3. *Airport noise zone.*

a. *Establishment.* There is hereby established the airport noise zone as an airport zone of influence. The airport noise zone is established around the Gainesville Regional Airport to regulate land uses sensitive to sound levels generated by the routine operation of the airport. Within the airport noise zone, land use restrictions and special construction standards are established to minimize impacts of airport-generated noise. The airport noise zone consists of three subzones, defined as follows:

i. *Airport noise subzone A:* The area commencing at the airport reference point and extending outward therefrom to that boundary which approximates a day night average sound level of 65 dB DNL.

ii. *Airport noise subzone B:* The area commencing at the airport reference point and extending outward therefrom to that boundary which approximates a day night average sound level of 60 dB DNL, excluding subzone A.

iii. *Airport noise subzone C:* The area commencing at the airport reference point and extending outward therefrom to that boundary which approximates a day night average sound level of 55 dB DNL, excluding subzones A and B.

For the Gainesville Regional Airport, the boundary of the airport noise zone established in these regulations is based on the forecast of day night average sound level noise contours documented in the 2012 Noise Exposure Map prepared for the Gainesville Regional Airport by RS&H and determined compliant by the FAA on April 20, 2009.

The airport noise zone map shall be adopted by ordinance. When future noise exposure maps are prepared and determined compliant by the FAA, the city shall consider revisions to the boundary of the airport noise zones and to these regulations. Any such revisions shall not be operative or effective for purposes of these regulations, until adopted by ordinance of the city.

b. *Regulations.* The provisions of this section shall apply to the construction, expansion, alteration, moving, repair, replacement, use, and changes of use or occupancy of any occupied structure located within any airport noise zone defined by these regulations and to any structure that is moved into or within any airport noise zone, and those proposed to be constructed within any airport noise zone.

i. *Existing structures.* Structures located within any airport noise zone at the time of the adoption of these regulations to which additions, expansions, alterations, repairs, replacement, and changes of use or occupancy are made shall comply with the requirements of these regulations, except for structures for which the cost of such additions, expansions, alterations, or repairs made within any five-year period does not exceed 50 percent of the value of such structures.

ii. *Moved structures.* Structures moved into or within any airport noise zone defined by these regulations shall comply with requirements of these regulations before permanent occupancy is permitted.

iii. *New structures.* New structures proposed within any airport noise zone defined by these regulations shall comply with the requirements of these regulations before permanent occupancy is permitted.

iv. *Avigation easements.* Property owners required or choosing to provide an avigation easement shall grant said easement to the City of Gainesville and to the Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Airport Authority, and to their respective successors and/or assigns. The easement shall be in the form provided by the city attorney and airport authority and shall be executed by the property owner and recorded by the property owner in the Public Records of Alachua County, prior to the earliest occurrence of the following: 1) release of a development site plan; 2) recording of a lot split, minor subdivision, or final plat; or 3) issuance of a building permit, as applicable. The property owner shall provide a copy of the recorded easement to the city and to the airport authority.

v. *Regulated uses within the airport noise zone.* Uses that are not specified in the following table may be allowed in the airport noise zone if permitted by the underlying zoning and other applicable land development regulations, provided all development shall provide a minimum of 25 dB of exterior-to-interior noise level reduction and the property owner shall provide the city and the Gainesville Regional Airport with a permanent avigation easement in accordance with this section.

The restrictions on the educational facilities of public and private schools map shall be adopted by ordinance. When future restrictions on the educational facilities of public and private schools maps are prepared, the city shall consider revisions to the boundary of the restrictions on the educational facilities of public and private schools and to these regulations. Any such revisions shall not be operative or effective for purposes of these regulations, until adopted by ordinance of the city.

b. *Existing educational facilities.* These restrictions shall not be construed to require the removal, alteration, sound conditioning, or other change, or to interfere with the continued use or adjacent expansion of any non-conforming educational structure or site, or be construed to prohibit the construction of any new structure for which a site has been determined as provided in F.S. § 1013.36.

i. *Exceptions.* Exceptions approving construction of an educational facility within the delineated area(s) shall only be granted when the development review board makes specific findings detailing how public policy reasons for allowing the construction outweigh health and safety concerns prohibiting such a location. The development review board shall consider, at a minimum, the following criteria in determining whether or not to grant exceptions approving construction of educational facilities within the delineated area(s):

1) Physical attributes of the proposed site, including the nature of the terrain and topography, and the density of planned/existing land uses;

2) Situation of the proposed site relative to other geographic features, either natural or man-made, and other planned/existing land uses and activities;

3) Public and private interests and investments;

4) Safety of persons on the ground and in the air;

10) Inbound approach or outbound departure bearing relative to the extended runway centerline.

G. *Determination of boundaries.* In determining the location of airport zone of influence boundaries, the following rules shall apply:

1. Where boundaries are shown to follow streets or alleys, the centerline of such streets or alleys shall be the airport zone boundary;

2. Where boundaries are shown to enter or cross platted lots, property lines of the lots shall be the airport zone boundary;

3. Notwithstanding the above, where boundaries are shown on any platted lot, provisions of the more restrictive airport zone that crosses the platted lot shall apply to the entire platted lot;

4. Where boundaries are shown to enter or cross unsubdivided property of less than five acres in area, property lines of the unsubdivided parcel shall be the airport zone boundary;

5. Notwithstanding the above, where boundaries are shown on unsubdivided property of less than five acres in area, provisions of the more restrictive airport zone that crosses the unsubdivided parcel shall apply to the entire unsubdivided parcel; and

6. Where boundaries are shown on unsubdivided property of five or more acres in area, the location shall be determined by the airport noise zone boundary shown in attachment 3, or the airport height notification zone or airport runway protection zone boundary located by application of the definition of said zone boundaries set forth in these regulations.

H. *Nonconforming uses.* No use of land, structure, development, or object of natural growth is allowable in any airport zone of influence unless it conforms to the specific limitations set forth in these regulations. The general nonconformity provisions in the Land Development Code shall apply to nonconformities with the airport zoning regulations to the extent they are not in conflict with this section. If there is a conflict between the nonconformity provisions of this section and the general provisions of the Land Development Code, the provisions of this section shall govern.

Except as otherwise stated in this section, any legal nonconformity that was allowable or permitted by the airport zoning regulations in existence at the time of its establishment shall be allowed to continue, and nothing herein shall be construed to require the removal, lowering, change or alteration, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any legal nonconformity. However, legal nonconformities shall not be allowed to exceed the height of said object at the time it was established as a legal nonconformity or to otherwise become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was at the time it was established as a legal nonconformity, unless an airport obstruction permit is issued by the city manager or designee in accordance with these airport zoning regulations.

1. If the city manager or designee determines that a nonconforming obstruction has been abandoned or is more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed, then the following shall apply:

a. An airport obstruction permit may not be granted if it would allow the obstruction to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the airport zoning regulations in place at the time of permit application; and

b. The city manager or designee may require the owner of the nonconforming obstruction, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, alter, or equip such obstruction as may be necessary to conform to the current airport zoning regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming obstruction neglects or refuses to comply with such requirement for ten calendar days after notice, the city may proceed to have the obstruction so lowered, removed, reconstructed, altered, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner of the obstruction or the land whereon it is or was located.

I. *Future uses.* No change shall be made in the use of land, and no structure shall be altered or otherwise established in any airport zone of influence created by these regulations except in conformance with the requirements of this section. Land use and zoning changes that would allow a prohibited use within an airport zone of influence shall be prohibited.

Properties with an incompatible land use and zoning map designation may be changed to a compatible land use and zoning by ordinance, planned use district (PUD) land use and planned development (PD) zoning may be used to designate new uses of properties within airport noise zones.

J. *Conflicting regulations.* Where there exists a conflict between any of the requirements or limitations prescribed in these regulations and any other requirements, regulations or zoning applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or objects of natural growth, the use of land, or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail.

K. *Penalties.* In addition to other remedies for violation of these regulations provided in the Land Development Code, the city may institute in any court of competent jurisdiction an action to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate any violation of F.S. Ch. 333, these regulations, or any order or ruling made in connection with their administration or enforcement. The court shall adjudge to the city such relief, by way of injunction (which may be mandatory) or otherwise, as may be proper under all the facts and circumstances of the case in order to fully effectuate the purposes of F.S. Ch. 333, and of these regulations, and the orders and rulings made pursuant thereto.

Sec. 30-4.27. Heritage overlay.

A. *Purpose.* The heritage overlay district is established as an overlay zoning district to maintain, protect, conserve and preserve residential areas with a distinct visual identity by regulating development to ensure compatibility with the existing style, character or identity of the district area. The purpose of this section is to create the process by which property owners can request that the city impose additional regulatory requirements upon their residential area in order to help conserve the design and visual characteristics that give the area a distinct identity and a harmonious appearance.

B. *Objectives.* The objectives of the heritage overlay district are to promote the economic, educational, aesthetic, cultural and general welfare of the city's residential neighborhoods by:

1. Encouraging property owners to participate in the development process within their general geographic areas;

2. Encouraging the use of existing buildings through adaptive rehabilitation;

3. Enhancing the diversity of the city's housing stock;

4. Encouraging construction that will lead to continuation, conservation and improvement that complements the scale and physical character of the original buildings; and

5. Protecting neighborhoods' distinct identities.

C. *Effect.*

1. The heritage overlay district classification is an overlay district classification. When the heritage overlay district is applied to any property, the underlying zoning district categories are neither abandoned nor repealed. The existing regulations remain in effect, with further restrictions on regulated work items as specified in the design standards report, and no building permit shall be issued for regulated work items without the approval of the heritage overlay district board. If there is a conflict between the provisions of the heritage overlay district and the underlying zoning district, the heritage overlay district prevails.

2. Design standards for regulated work items shall be specified in each ordinance that places the heritage overlay district on an area.

3. Whether or not the regulated work item is consistent with standards of the applicable heritage overlay district shall be determined by the heritage overlay district board, based on the adopted ordinance for that particular district.

4. The heritage overlay district shall be applied only to residential uses zoned SF and RC. Changing the zoning of a parcel to a zoning district other than SF or RC shall also require a simultaneous rezoning to remove the heritage overlay district.

5. Fees for petitions to designate an area as a heritage overlay district or to amend an existing district, for verification of petition signatures and for petitions for review of regulated work items shall be paid to the city in accordance with the schedule set out in appendix A and such payment shall be made at the time of submitting a petition to the city.

D. *Criteria.* An area shall meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for designation as a heritage overlay district:

1. It shall consist of at least 25 compact and contiguous parcels and shall not cause the creation of an enclave or pocket within the area, as those terms have been defined by Florida Statutes and case law relating to annexations;

2. Residences within the area shall consist only of one- and two-family dwellings;

3. All land within the area shall be zoned RSF-1, RSF-2, RSF-3, RSF-4, or RC;

4. Each boundary of the area shall be one of the following identifiable landmarks: a street, alley, publicly owned right-of-way, platted subdivision boundary, or a creek; and

5. No area boundaries shall overlap the boundary of an existing heritage overlay district or historic district.

E. *Additional criteria.* In addition, an area shall meet one of the following criteria to be eligible for designation as a heritage overlay district:

1. Its visual characteristics give it a distinct identity;

2. It has distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style valuable for the study of a period, method of construction, or use of indigenous materials; or

3. It has character as a geographically definable area possessing a significant concentration of buildings or structures united by its plan or physical development.

F. *Procedures.* The procedures for application and designation are as follows:

1. *Application and process.* Any owner of property within a proposed heritage overlay district may apply by petition to have that area designated a heritage overlay district and impose special regulations on that area. The process for the imposition of the overlay district shall be as provided in article III of this chapter for zoning changes. The city plan board and the city commission may approve the overlay district boundaries and regulations only with a finding, supported by data and analysis, that the area has unique and identifiable features and characteristics, that those characteristics are or may be threatened by incompatible or inconsistent development, and that the proposed regulations are reasonably related to protecting those identified features and characteristics.

2. *Petition requirements.* In order to impose the heritage overlay district on an area, a petition requesting imposition of the overlay district on that area shall be submitted to the city on forms provided by the city. Each petition shall meet all of the following requirements:

a. The petitioner shall be an owner of legal title of property located within the proposed overlay district area and shall be the designated contact person responsible for processing the petition with the city;

b. The petition shall clearly and accurately describe the proposed boundaries of the area and shall include an accurate, reproducible map of the proposed overlay district area depicting all lot divisions, block divisions, roads and the boundaries of the area;

c. The petition shall include a design standards report, as described in subsection 4. below;

d. At a minimum, the petition shall contain authentic signatures of a majority of the homestead property owners (as further described in subsection 3. below) within the proposed overlay district area. To be verified by the city, signatures shall be accompanied by the legibly printed name of the signer, the address of the parcel owned by the signer, the parcel number of the parcel owned by the signer, and the date the petition was signed. Signatures dated more than six months prior to the date the petition is filed with the city are not acceptable. For the purpose of the petition, jointly owned parcels are considered owned by a single person, and any co-owner may sign a petition for the parcel. Only one owner of each parcel shall be included in the majority requirement stated above. If a person owns more than one parcel of property within the proposed district area, that person may sign the petition one time for each parcel owned; and

e. The petition shall advise each signer of the general type of restrictions that may be imposed on the property if the overlay district is imposed upon the area.

3. *Petition verification.* When the petition is submitted to the city, the city manager or designee shall verify the names, signatures, and homestead status of the property, and shall determine whether the petition meets the criteria of this section. For a signature and homestead status to be verified, the homestead status of the property and the printed name of the petition signer shall be consistent with the current records of the Alachua County Property Appraiser. If an insufficient number of acceptable homestead property owner signatures are submitted, the city shall return the petition and petition fee to the petitioner. However, the city shall retain the verification fee.

4. *Design standards report.* The petitioner shall submit a proposed design standards report for the proposed heritage overlay district area. If the heritage overlay designation is approved, the design standards report shall be included in the ordinance that imposes the overlay. The report shall include the following:

a. A map that clearly depicts the boundaries of the proposed area and identifies all lot divisions, block divisions and roads;

b. Architectural surveys that define the prior, current and likely future character of the area. This shall include a field survey containing written and visual information that documents items such as, but not limited to, distinctive building features, represented building style, typical building components, finishing materials, siting of buildings, degree of visual continuity, and degree of compatibility of new structures with architectural context;

c. A clear, decipherable data set of area features that describe the character of individual building types. This set shall define the relationships among features and shall serve as a tool to identify common elements in the area; and

d. Based on the data, identify important characteristics and features and specify the standards by which those characteristics will be preserved and continued, and specify the regulated work items that will require review by the heritage overlay district board. All design standards regulating a particular work item should be specific and measurable, such as by height, width, amount, spacing or location. Construction, installation, addition, enlargement, relocation or removal, of a regulated work item will be subject to review and approval by the heritage overlay district board as specified in the design standards report. This section does not require that each of the regulated work items listed below be addressed in a design standards report, only those items that are applicable or desirable to preserve the character of the area as determined in the design standards report. Regulated work items are limited to any one or more of the following:

i. Accessory structures;

ii. Building heights;

iii. Building height-to-width ratio;

iv. Building orientation;

v. Building setback and build-to lines;

vi. Bulk plane restrictions;

vii. Exterior building materials;

viii. Fences;

ix. Front porches and balconies;

x. Garage doors;

xi. Lot widths;

xii. Off-street parking design;

xiii. Percent of the lot covered by buildings;

xiv. Roof lines, shapes and materials;

xv. Screening of mechanical equipment; or

xvi. Windows and doors.

e. A heritage overlay district may not modify the list of permitted uses for its underlying zoning district(s). In addition, the following shall not be regulated in any manner by a heritage overlay district classification:

i. Colors of structures;

ii. Demolitions, in whole or in part;

iii. Interior layout or interior construction;

iv. Power generating solar panels;

v. Television satellite dishes or antennae; and

vi. Vegetation.

5. *Amendments to district.* Any property owner within a heritage overlay district may apply for an amendment to the district's design standards report. Any property owner whose land is contiguous to a heritage overlay district may apply for inclusion in the district through extension of the district's boundaries. Any land added to an existing heritage overlay district shall be subject to the adopted ordinance for that heritage overlay district and shall not be required to submit a new or revised design standards report with the petition for extension of the boundaries. All amendments shall be subject to review and consideration according to the applicable terms of this section and shall be processed as a zoning change (if amending the district boundaries) or as a text change (if amending the design standards report) in accordance with article III of this chapter. The city commission may amend or repeal any heritage overlay district from time to time in accordance with the same standards and procedures.

(Ord. No. 2024-263, § 8, 10-3-24)

Sec. 30-4.28. Historic preservation/conservation overlay.

A. *Findings.* The city commission hereby finds as follows:

1. There are located within the city districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas, both public and private, which are reminders of past eras, events and persons important in local, state or national history, or which provide significant examples of architectural styles of the past, or which are unique and irreplaceable assets to the city and its neighborhoods, or which provide for this and future generations examples of the physical surroundings in which past generations lived;

2. In recognition of these assets, the city has adopted the Comprehensive Plan historic preservation element;

3. The historic preservation element of the Comprehensive Plan by reference includes a survey of historic and cultural resources which has been adopted;

4. Through this and other dedicated efforts of local public and private groups and individuals, the value of a district and several sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas, both public and private, has been recognized by their inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, the state inventory maintained by the division of archives, history and records management, department of state, the city's survey of cultural resources, and/or the county architectural survey; however, many other resources remain unidentified;

5. The recognition, protection, enhancement and use of such resources is a public purpose and is essential to the health, safety, morals and economic, educational, cultural and general welfare of the public, since these efforts result in the enhancement of property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and areas of the city, the increase of economic benefits to the city and its inhabitants, the promotion of local interest, the enrichment of human life in its educational and cultural dimensions, serving spiritual as well as material needs, and the fostering of civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past;

6. It is the policy of the city to encourage beautification and general improvement of and cleanliness within the city by requiring the installation of appropriate landscaping which will enhance the community's ecological, environmental and aesthetic qualities and which will preserve the value of the property;

7. The city has for many years exerted efforts in an attempt to encourage redevelopment of the original center of the city and continues to do so;

8. The city commission desires to take advantage of all available state and federal laws and programs that may assist in the development of the city;

9. The federal government has established a program of matching grants-in-aid for projects having as their purpose the preservation for public benefit of properties that are significant in American history and architecture;

10. There are other federal programs providing monies for projects involving the rehabilitation of existing districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas;

11. The policy of the city is to conserve the existing housing stock and extend the economic life of each housing unit through the rehabilitation of such units under housing and neighborhood development programs in selected areas;

12. The city, in applying for block grant funds under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, shall comply with the requirements of several federal laws relating to the protection of historical, architectural, archaeological and cultural resources as part of the environmental review process;

13. Inherent in the enactment and implementation of these federal mandates is the policy of the United States government that the spirit and direction of the nation are founded upon and reflected in its historic past; that the historical and cultural foundations of the nation should be preserved as a living part of our community life and development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people; that in the face of the ever-increasing extensions of urban centers, highways, and residential, commercial and industrial developments, the present governmental and nongovernmental programs and activities are inadequate to ensure future generations a genuine opportunity to appreciate and enjoy the rich heritage of our nation;

14. It is the will of the people of the state as expressed in Article II, Section 7 of the 1968 Constitution, that the state's natural resources and scenic beauty be conserved and protected; and

15. It is the will of the state legislature, as expressed in F.S. Ch. 267, that the state's historic sites and properties, buildings, artifacts, treasure troves and objects of antiquity, which have scientific or historical value, or are of interest to the public, be protected and preserved.

B. *Purpose.* In recognition of these findings, the purpose of this section is to promote the health, morals, economic, educational, aesthetic, cultural, and general welfare of the public through:

1. The identification, protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects and areas that are reminders of past eras, events and persons important in local, state or national history, or which provide significant examples of architectural styles of the past, or which are unique and irreplaceable assets to the city and its neighborhoods, or which provide this and future generations examples of the physical surroundings in which past generations lived;

2. The enhancement of property values, the stabilization of neighborhoods and business centers of the city, the increase of economic and financial benefits to the city and its inhabitants, and the promotion of local interests;

3. The preservation and enhancement of varied architectural styles, reflecting the city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history; and

4. The enrichment of human life in its educational and cultural dimensions in order to serve spiritual as well as material needs by fostering knowledge of the living heritage of the past.

C. *Local register of historic places.*

1. *Creation.* A local register of historic places is hereby created as a means of identifying, classifying and protecting various sites, buildings, structures, objects, and districts as historic or architecturally significant.

2. *Process.*

a. *Nomination.* The city commission, the historic preservation board, or the owner of a site, building, structure, or object may nominate such for placement on the local register by submitting a form provided by the city. Nominations of individually listed properties by the city commission or the historic preservation board shall have the consent of the property owner, or shall be approved with a six-sevenths vote of the city commission and a six-ninths vote of the historic preservation board.

b. *Removal.* Application may be made for the removal of a property from the local register, and the same procedure shall be employed as in the placement of a property on the local register. A property may be removed if the board makes a new and negative evaluation of the reasons for its original recommendation or for any other valid reason approved by the board.

c. Upon receipt of a completed nomination form, including necessary documentation, the city manager or designee shall place the nomination on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the historic preservation board. If the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board is too close in time to allow for the required notice to be given, the nomination shall be placed on the agenda of the succeeding regularly scheduled meeting.

d. The historic preservation board shall, within 90 calendar days from the date of the meeting at which the nomination is first on the board's agenda, review the nomination and write a recommendation thereon. The recommendation shall include specific findings and conclusions as to why the nomination does or does not meet the appropriate criteria for listing on the local register. The recommendation shall also include any owner's objection to the listing. If the nomination is of a district, the recommendation shall also clearly specify, through the use of maps, lists, or other means, those buildings, objects, or structures that are classified as contributing to the historical significance of the district.

e. The nomination form and the board's recommendation shall be sent to the city plan board. The nomination shall then be handled as any other rezoning and the procedure for amendments to the Land Development Code set forth in this chapter shall be followed. From the date the board recommends the nomination to the city plan board until the city commission either approves or denies the amendment to the Land Development Code, or until one year has elapsed, whichever shall occur first, no permit for the demolition or relocation of a structure nominated for individual listing on the local register or of a structure classified as contributing to the character of a district nominated for listing on the local register shall be issued unless the board follows the procedures and requirements for a certificate of appropriateness set forth in this section and finds that such a permit may be issued.

3. *Review criteria.* In order to be listed on the local register, a site, building, object, structure, or district shall be determined to be significant and to possess integrity. To be significant, a building, object, structure, or district shall meet at least three of the criteria listed below, or if approved by at least six members of the historic preservation board at least one of the criteria listed below. A site, building, object, structure, or district shall possess integrity as defined by the National Park Service in National Register Bulletin #15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture is present in a district, site, building, structure, or object when the district, site, building, structure, or object:

a. Is associated with events that are significant to our local, state, or national history;

b. Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction;

c. Represents the work of a master;

d. Possesses high artistic values; or

e. Represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction.

4. *Recording.* Upon placement of a property or properties on the local register, the board shall cause this designation to be recorded in the official record books of the county.

5. *Certificate and signs.* The city manager or designee shall issue an official certificate of historic significance to the owner of properties listed individually on the local register or judged as contributing to the character of a district listed on the local register. The city manager or designee is additionally authorized to issue and place official signs denoting the geographic boundaries of each district listed on the local register.

D. *Effect.*

1. *Modification of existing zoning requirements.* Placement of sites, buildings, structures, objects, or districts on the local register of historic places is an overlay district classification, and the underlying zoning district categories are neither abandoned nor repealed. The existing regulations remain in effect and are modified only to the extent provided for in this section.

2. *Modification of dimensional requirements.* To facilitate new construction, redevelopment, rehabilitation, or relocation of buildings or structures in historic districts or individually listed on the local register, the city manager or designee or the appropriate board within the development review process may determine dimensional requirements such as front, side, and rear setbacks, building height, separation between buildings, floor area ratios, and maximum lot coverage for buildings and structures based on historic development patterns. Any change shall be based on competent demonstration by the petitioner of the following:

a. The proposed development will not affect the public safety, health, or welfare of abutting property owners or the district;

b. The proposed change is consistent with historic development, design patterns or themes in the historic district. Such patterns may include reduced front, rear, and side yard setbacks, maximum lot coverage and large floor area ratios;

c. The proposal reflects a particular theme or design pattern that will advance the development pattern of the historic district; and

d. The proposed complies with utility, stormwater, access requirements, and other requirements related to site design in the Land Development Code.

Where the proposed modification would encroach into a side or rear yard setback that adjoins an existing lot, notice will be provided to the adjacent property owner. Staff or the appropriate reviewing board will document the basis for its decision. If staff makes the decision, it will provide a written determination on the complete modification request within 21 calendar days of receiving the request. If the adjacent property owner objects to the encroachment in writing within 16 calendar days of the date from which the notice was mailed, the request shall be referred to the development review board, which shall review the request using the same standards in this section used by staff. If the decision is to be made by a board, the board shall hear the objection of the adjacent property owner as part of its public hearing. The remainder of the requirements, regulations and procedures set forth in this chapter shall remain applicable.

3. *Modification of building code requirements.* Structures and buildings listed individually on the local register or deemed contributing to the character of a district listed on the local register shall be deemed historic and entitled to modified enforcement of the standard codes where appropriate.

4. *Ad valorem tax exemption.* Historic properties may be eligible for an exemption from ad valorem taxes resulting from an increase in value as specified by the provisions of chapter 25, article IV of the Code of Ordinances.

5. *Demolition by neglect.* The intent of this section is to stop the continuing deterioration of historic properties and neighborhoods through application of chapters 13 and 16 of the Code of Ordinances.

a. The historic preservation board may, on its own initiative, file a formal complaint with the codes enforcement division requesting repair or correction of defects to any designated structure so that it is preserved and protected.

b. The code enforcement division shall provide written notice to the staff member assigned to the historic preservation board when a building or structure that is either listed on the national or local historic register or is a contributing structure to either a nationally or locally designated historic district is deemed:

i. As having a minor or major housing code violation, or

ii. "Dangerous," as defined by chapter 16 of the Code of Ordinances.

Upon receipt of this notice, the city manager or designee is authorized to access these properties accompanied by a code enforcement officer to assess the damage that formed the basis for the decision to find the building "dangerous." The assessment will be presented to the historic preservation board, which shall be allowed to appeal the determination to the development review board pursuant to section 16-27 of the Code of Ordinances and present evidence against the determination that the building is "dangerous."

E. *Certificate of appropriateness.*

1. *Required.* A certificate of appropriateness is required in accordance with this section for any sites, buildings, structures, objects, or districts on the local register of historic places. No final approval of development plans and no building or demolition permit shall be granted for any development that includes any of the actions specified in this section without the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. If a certificate of appropriateness is issued for demolition in conjunction with new construction, the applicant shall file a development plan or apply for a building permit prior to receiving a demolition permit.

2. *Effective term.* A certificate of appropriateness is effective for one year from the date of approval. After one year, the applicant shall reapply for a new certificate of appropriateness and shall be subject to any changes in the Historic Preservation Rehabilitation and Design Guidelines that took effect during the intervening period.

3. *Applicability.* A property owner/agent shall obtain a certificate of appropriateness before: 1) performing any of the following external work items on a structure listed individually on the local register or designated as contributing to a district listed on the local register, 2) performing work regarding fencing or additions to a lot or structure designated as noncontributing to a district listed on the local register, or 3) taking any of the actions listed in subsection 5. below. However, ordinary maintenance, as defined in this chapter, may be performed without first receiving a certificate of appropriateness.

k. *Directional expression of front elevation.* A building, structure, object or parking lot shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually related in its directional character.

2. *Review criteria for relocations.* In addition to the guidelines provided in subsection 3. below concerning demolition, issuance of certificates of appropriateness for relocations shall be guided by the following factors:

a. The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting;

b. Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding areas will be;

c. Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and

d. Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure or object.

3. *Review criteria for demolitions.* A decision by the historic preservation board approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, or objects other than those in the Pleasant Street Historic District shall be guided by:

a. The historic or architectural significance of the building, structure or object;

b. The importance of the building, structure or object to the ambience of a district;

c. The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure or object because of its design, texture, material, detail or unique location;

d. Whether the building, structure or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the county or the region;

e. Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be;

f. Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure or object from collapse; and

g. Whether the building, structure or object is capable of earning reasonable economic return on its value.

4. *Review criteria for demolitions in Pleasant Street Historic District.* A decision by the historic preservation board approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, or objects in the Pleasant Street Historic District shall be guided by:

a. *The significance of the property.* Significance concerns historic or architectural aspects of the building, structure, or object. A property shall be considered to be significant if it meets one the following criteria:

i. The property is located on an important street and within a cluster of historic buildings. Cluster of historic buildings is defined by the presence of three historic buildings adjacent to each other on the same block as the property proposed for demolition, either on the same side of the street, across the street, or on adjacent side street of the block containing the property. Important streets is defined as NW 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Street, NW 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Avenue, NW 4th or 6th Place, the 200—600 block of NW 1st Street, the 200—400 block of NW 7th Avenue, and the 300 block of NW 5th Avenue.

ii. The property is located on an important street or within a cluster of historic buildings, and meets one of the following criteria: 1) It maintains its basic plan and additions, if any, were made to nonprominent elevations and porches were not enclosed; 2) Its features are unique and there are few remaining occupied buildings of its type in the neighborhood; or 3) It is associated with an important person based on original ownership documentation contained in the nomination of Pleasant Street to the National Register of Historic Places.

iii. The property is not on an important street and not within a cluster of historic buildings, but it has been evaluated for its architectural quality and structural condition and merits preservation.

b. *Plans for redevelopment.* Demolition of historic building without definitive plans for redevelopment is discouraged. This factor evaluates the proposed reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be.

c. *Condition of the building.* The historic preservation board will evaluate the structural integrity, weathertightness and the economic feasibility of rehabilitation based on the condition of the roof, foundation and walls as well as the cost of replicating features and details on the historic building in any proposal for new development, and will determine if reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, or object from collapse. The applicant shall allow the city manager or designee to inspect the structure with reasonable notice.

5. *Consideration of economic impact on property owner.* If an owner claims that the decision of the historic preservation board will cause economic hardship, he or she may petition the board for a hearing to consider relevant evidence of hardship. The owner shall submit all evidence to the city manager or designee within 60 calendar days of the board's original decision. The hearing shall then be held at the next regular board meeting taking place at least 24 calendar days after the evidence is submitted.

The historic preservation board shall review all the evidence presented at the public hearing and make a determination no later than 30 calendar days after the hearing. The applicant shall show by competent substantial evidence that the denial or conditional approval of the certificate of appropriateness or demolition permit has caused or will cause an economic hardship. If the board determines that the applicant has proved economic hardship, it shall consider whether relief is available that will not result in economic hardship and will provide minimal adverse effect to the historic building or structure. If found, the board may grant this relief, or grant the relief requested with conditions that ensure the minimum adverse effect and does not result in unreasonable economic hardship.

Relevant evidence includes the following:

a. A written estimate from a licensed engineer, contractor or architect with experience in rehabilitation of the cost of the proposed construction, or alteration, and a written estimate of any additional cost that would be incurred in order to comply with the recommendation of the historic preservation board. "Experience in rehabilitation" means work on certified rehabilitation projects where federal tax credits for historic preservation were received, or work on a building or structure in Florida which required a local certificate of appropriateness;

b. A written report from a licensed engineer, contractor or architect with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of the subject structure and its suitability for rehabilitation. The report shall include detailed documentation (including scope of work, and cost of materials and labor) of the cost of complying with the recommendation of the historic preservation board;

c. An independent written appraisal by an appraiser with competent credentials of the estimated market value of the property in its current condition; after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal; after any changes recommended by the historic preservation board; and, in the case of a proposed demolition, both after renovation of the existing property for continued use and after demolition and new construction (an appraiser shall at least have a state license to be considered competent);

d. In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from a licensed architect, contractor, certified appraiser or other professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property. Estimates of the proposed construction cost shall include the cost of replacing the historic structure with one of similar design and character-defining interior and exterior features; and

e. The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased, and any terms of financing between the seller and buyer.

If the property is income-producing the historic preservation board may also consider the following information in determining economic hardship:

f. The annual gross income from the property for the previous two years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two years; and depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period.

g. All appraisals performed by a certified appraiser within the previous two years for the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property.

h. Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and offers received, if any, within the previous two years.

i. The assessed value of the property according to the two most recent assessments.

j. The real estate taxes for the previous two years.

k. The form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture or other.

l. Any other information, including the income tax bracket of the owner, applicant or principal investors in the property, considered necessary by the preservation board to a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owners.

b. Grant the certificate of appropriateness with special modifications and conditions;

c. Grant the certificate of appropriateness with a deferred effective date, which date shall not exceed one year from the date of issuance;

d. Deny the certificate of appropriateness; or

e. Grant the certificate of appropriateness if the historic preservation board finds that the property cannot be put to a reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the proposed work; in the case of income-producing property, the historic preservation board shall, before making its decision, determine whether the applicant can obtain a reasonable return from the property without the approval of the proposed work.

6. *Action on denial or deferral.* Where the certificate is denied or issued with a deferred effective date, the historic preservation board shall take or promote the taking of an action desirable for the conservation or preservation of the structure, building, object or area. Such action shall include impressing the desirability of preservation and/or conservation upon the property owner and recommending to him various alternatives that would make the project acceptable.

7. *Effect of failure to decide within time limit.* Failure of the historic preservation board to act within the time limits established shall be deemed an approval of the application, and, upon request of the applicant, the building official shall issue any permit dependent upon the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.

8. *Appeals.* Any person aggrieved by a decision rendered by the historic preservation board may appeal the decision to the appeals reviewing authority as provided in this chapter.

9. *Posting requirement.* No work for which a certificate of appropriateness is required may be undertaken unless a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the work is conspicuously posted on the property with appropriate building permits where the work is to be performed.

H. *Emergency issuance of certificates of appropriateness.* The following procedure shall be used when the building official or designee determines that a building or structure listed on the local register of historic places or located within a district on the local register of historic places is in imminent danger of structural failure or collapse due to an event or events outside the control of the owner of the structure.

1. The building official or designee shall convene a meeting of an emergency committee which shall consist of the building official or designee, the city manager or designee and a member of the historic preservation board who is an architect, engineer or building contractor.

This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this section, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to future secondary effects that could occur in the city related to current sexually oriented businesses as well as sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city in the future. The city finds that the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

C. *Spacing.* A sexually oriented business may not be established in any permitted district unless all other requirements of the chapter pertaining to such districts and to buildings generally are met and unless the sexually oriented business is at least 1,000 feet from any other sexually oriented business, place of religious assembly, public school, private school, public park, youth association or residential area.

1. *Measurement.* For purposes of the spacing requirements, the measurement shall be made by extending a straight line from the nearest property line of the sexually oriented business to the nearest property line of the other sexually oriented business, place of religious assembly, public school, private school, public park, youth association or residential area. If any such use is located in a multi-tenant building, then property line shall mean the nearest line of the leasehold or other space actually controlled or occupied by the sexually oriented business, place of religious assembly, public school, private school or youth association.

2. *Exemption to spacing requirement.* Any sexually oriented business that is established in conformity with this section and other applicable laws and ordinances shall not be made unlawful, if a place of religious assembly, public school, private school, public park or residential area is created or established within the distance limitations subsequent to the filing with the city of the application for the establishment of the sexually oriented business or subsequent to the lawful establishment of the sexually oriented business.

D. *Obscenity not permitted.* Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitted or allowing a violation of any state or federal law, including F.S. Ch. 847, relating to obscenity.

E. *Existing establishments.* Any use herein defined as a sexually oriented motion picture theater, retail store or cabaret that is on April 15, 2010, existing, in actual operation and open to the public, and which in all other respects is in full compliance with applicable laws and ordinances of the city, but which would not otherwise be permitted under the terms of this section, shall then become a permitted nonconforming use.

F. *Sexually oriented motion picture theaters.* Any sexually oriented motion picture theater shall meet the following design standards at all times:

1. *Presentation area.* All screenings and presentations of motion pictures, videos or other visual media shall occur in a room open to all customers of the establishment and containing at least 600 square feet of floor area. No curtains, screens, shades or other devices shall be used to obscure any part of the room.

2. *Lighting.* The lighting level in the area occupied by customers shall be at least two footcandles at floor level.

3. *Seating.* Seating shall consist of individual, theater-style chairs, with solid arms separating the chairs. No couches, benches, individual chairs, beds, loose cushions or mattresses, or other forms of seating may be provided. Separate spaces for wheelchairs shall be provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of the adopted building code in effect and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

G. *Sexually oriented cabarets.* In addition to those standards applicable to adult performance establishments, the following design standards shall apply to any sexually oriented cabaret at all times:

1. *Presentation area.* All performances and all interactions between performers and customers shall occur in a room open to all customers of the establishment and containing at least 600 square feet of floor area. No curtains, screens, shades or other devices shall be used to obscure any part of the room.

2. *Lighting.* The lighting level in the area occupied by customers shall be at least five footcandles at a height of three feet off the floor.

H. *Retail store with limited quantities of sexually oriented media or devices.* A retail trade establishment (SIC Division G) that devotes more than ten percent but less than 30 percent of its floor area, or stocks more than ten percent but less than 30 percenter of the number of items in inventory, to sexually oriented media or sexually oriented devices, shall be treated for zoning purposes as an accessory use to the primary retail trade of the store and not as a sexually oriented retail store, provided that it meets all of the following conditions (however, these conditions shall not apply to a retail trade establishment that allows only persons who are 18 years of age or older to enter the premises):

1. All sexually oriented media or devices shall be maintained in a room that is separated from other material by an opaque wall that extends to the ceiling or eight feet above the floor, whichever is less.

2. Access to the room containing the sexually oriented media or devices shall be through a door or through a space that can be entered only by passing directly by the manager's or cashier's principal work station.

3. The room containing sexually oriented media or devices shall be posted with a notice indicating that only persons 18 years of age or older are allowed in the room.

4. Access to the room shall be physically limited to adults through control of access by an employee of the store, through use of an access release located at least 66 inches off the floor, or through constant monitoring of the room by an employee on duty, where such employee has visual control of the separate room through direct visibility, through electronic means or through a window or mirror providing visibility into the room from the manager's or cashier's work station.

Sec. 30-5.33. Wireless communication facilities and antenna regulations.

A. *Purpose.* These regulations were developed to protect the health, safety and welfare of residents of the city, and to protect property values and minimize visual impact while furthering the development of enhanced telecommunications services in the city. These standards are designed to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the requirements of F.S. Ch. 365. The provisions of this section are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. This section shall not be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent services, consistent with federal regulations. These regulations are intended to:

1. Provide uniform standards for the provision of both radio and television broadcast signals and telecommunication services, including two-way radio, paging, personal communication services (PCS), cellular and related wireless services;

2. Protect the natural features and aesthetic character of the city by regulating the location, design and operation of wireless communication facilities, with special attention to residential neighborhoods, public parks, transportation view corridors, historic districts, historic landmarks, and environmentally sensitive lands;

3. Minimize the adverse visual and aesthetic impacts of wireless communication facilities through innovative design, siting and landscaping standards, including incentives to promote the use of camouflaged towers, collocation of new antennas on existing communication towers and the placement of antennas on roofs, walls, existing towers and other existing structures;

4. Accommodate the growing demand for wireless communication services, consistent with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, and ensure an efficient and high-quality wireless communications network; and

5. Expedite the review process for those new applicants choosing the least intrusive alternative of deploying wireless telecommunication services.

B. *Applicability and general requirements.* The requirements of this section apply to all wireless communication facilities and broadcast towers. All property within the city limits shall be subject to the requirements of this section. It is the intent of the city to impose all regulations of this section to all land within the city, whether publicly or privately held, except as specifically provided herein. These regulations shall supersede all other code provisions concerning wireless communications facilities for those applications for development review that are filed on or after July 1, 2005, unless otherwise provided in law. Setback and separation distances shall be applied regardless of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries. The design, construction and installation of wireless communications facilities shall comply with all applicable building codes.

C. *Collocation.* Collocation on any existing facility or structure shall be completed in accordance with the standards stated in F.S. § 365.172(11), as applicable. All other collocations shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of subsection H. and, if applicable, subsection J.

D. *Modification of existing towers.* Pursuant to F.S. § 365.172(11), an existing tower, including a nonconforming tower, may be structurally modified in order to permit collocation or may be replaced through no more than administrative review and building permit review and is not subject to public hearing review if the overall height of the tower is not increased and, if a replacement, the replacement tower is a monopole tower or, if the existing tower is a camouflaged tower, the replacement tower is a like-camouflaged tower.

If a wireless provider demonstrates to the satisfaction of the city that the provider cannot reasonably provide its service to the residential area or zone from outside the residential area or zone, the city and provider shall cooperate to determine an appropriate location for a wireless communications facility of an appropriate design within the residential area or zone. In no instance shall the height of a camouflage tower in a single-family or residential-low zoning category exceed 80 feet in height, and shall be subject to a special use permit by the city plan board. The city may require that the wireless provider reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by the city in cooperating in this determination.

1. *Height.* The maximum height of camouflaged towers in multiple-family, office or mixed-use districts, as listed in Table 1, below and in U1 and U6, is 80 feet. The maximum height of camouflaged towers in all other districts is 110 feet, except that in industrial districts a camouflaged tower may be a height of up to 130 feet. Camouflaged towers may be constructed in excess of the maximum heights listed above, provided a special use permit is issued in accordance with article III.

2. *Setbacks.* For purposes of structural safety and aesthetics, regardless of the zoning district in which a camouflaged tower is located, the tower shall be set back a distance of at least the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line.

3. *Collocation.* Any camouflaged tower in excess of 110 feet in height shall be designed to support the facilities of at least three providers, including the facilities of the applicant. Any camouflaged tower in excess of 70 feet in height but less than 110 feet in height shall be designed to support the facilities of at least two providers, including the facilities of the applicant.

4. *Development plan approval.* Development plan approval for new uses shall be done in accordance with: the review procedures stated in article III; the provisions for neighborhood workshops stated in article III; and with the requirements as listed below in subsection L., submittal requirements. The base application fee for review of any development plan application to construct a camouflaged tower shall be the same as the fee for intermediate plan review, plus the fee for a special use permit, if necessary, and the fee for the technical consultant, if deemed necessary by the city. All proposed new camouflaged towers shall be architecturally and/or aesthetically compatible with the surrounding community. To determine architectural and/or aesthetic compatibility with the surrounding community, a public hearing shall be held before the development review board on the development plan application; however, if a special use permit is required for approval of the proposed camouflaged tower, a public hearing shall be held before the city plan board on the development plan application.

In addition, sidewalk cafés in state right-of-way are subject to approval by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), all terms and conditions imposed by FDOT, and are subject to termination by FDOT. All license agreements are subject to the following minimum terms and conditions:

A. The principal use and sidewalk café must remain in compliance with the requirements of this Code.

The licensee shall release, indemnify and hold harmless the city, and the State of Florida if the sidewalk café is located in a state right-of-way, for any personal injury or property damage resulting from the existence or operation of the sidewalk café and the condition and maintenance of the right-of-way upon which it is located, including utilities located within the right-of-way.

D. For a sidewalk café located in a city right-of-way, the licensee shall maintain general liability insurance in an amount not less than $500,000.00 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage. The city shall be named as an additional insured, as evidenced by a policy endorsement.

However, where a sidewalk café is adjacent to a lane of traffic with no on-street parking and located on an arterial street, a minimum six-foot wide clear, straight, and visually unobstructed pedestrian path must be maintained on the sidewalk at all times. The width of a required clear pedestrian path may be increased during the day or decreased at night by the city manager or designee if deemed advisable for the public health, safety and welfare. However, in no event shall the clear pedestrian path be less than three feet in width.

H. When adjacent to on-street parking, sidewalk cafés may include the area adjacent to the curbline, provided there is sufficient sidewalk width to maintain a five-foot wide clear pedestrian path. Curbside seating must allow enough space for on-street parked cars to safely open vehicle doors and enter or exit vehicles. With written authorization from the city manager or designee, sidewalk cafés may at certain designated times extend to on-street parking areas directly in front of the principal use.

I. Sidewalk cafés may use the sidewalk in front of the abutting property in the same building or within the same block provided written permission is obtained from the property owner.

A. *Duration.* Such temporary permits shall not exceed one year in duration, but shall be renewable annually for a total of four consecutive years. In considering renewal of a temporary permit, the appropriate reviewing board, upon investigation by the city manager, or designee, shall determine that the permit holder is operating in compliance with the provisions of this section and with any special conditions set by the appropriate reviewing board, and evaluate the impact of the model home units on the surrounding developing neighborhood. If the appropriate reviewing board determines that, due to increased noise, light, glare, activity or for a violation of any special condition placed upon the operation of model home units by the appropriate reviewing board, the model home units are having an undesirable impact on the neighborhood, the temporary permit shall not be renewed.

B. *Location.* Any model home unit site issued a temporary permit shall be immediately identified by a sign affixed to the property prior to the sale of any abutting lot or dwelling unit to a person other than the operator of the model home unit. Such graphics shall clearly identify the site as a model home unit.

C. *Number.* The maximum number of model home units allowed in any one residential development, planned development and mixed-use development is limited as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Number of** **Approved Dwellings** | **Number of Model Home Units** |
| 1 to 50 | 3 units |
| 51 or more | 5% of approved dwelling units (rounded to the nearest whole number) |

For purposes of this section, the number of approved dwelling units means the cumulative number of dwelling units approved at final development plan, subdivision or planned development review(s) for any one residential development or residential planned development. However, in detached single-family dwellings the number of allowable model home units shall not exceed the number necessary to provide one example of each dwelling unit type offered in the residential development or residential planned development. Reversed floor plans and exterior facade variations will not be considered a separate dwelling unit type.

D. *Use as office.* Although residential sales and presentations may be undertaken at a model home unit, the operator of the model home unit shall have a primary office in a properly zoned area and not in a residential development or the residential section of a planned development. A primary office is defined as a relatively fixed place of business where the activities of the operator of the model home unit are administered, including sales, or managed and informational data on employees, payroll, receipts and other establishment-type records are maintained. A model home unit shall not operate or function as a construction office. The model home shall be used primarily for demonstrating the type of units offered in the subdivision.

E. *Parking.* Permanent, hard-surface parking shall not exceed that normally provided for other residential structures of the same type in the same residential development or residential planned development. The location and use of any temporary parking shall comply with all requirements of the approved development plan for the residential development or residential planned development. The development plan shall clearly indicate the type of allowable pervious material which shall be capable of supporting parking activities.

F. *Amendments.* If a model home unit is included in the development plan of an approved residential development, planned development or mixed-use development, any amendments or modifications to the model home unit shall be processed in the same manner as an amendment to an approved final development plan.

B. The sales period for seasonal or temporary goods, such as Christmas trees, shall not exceed 30 calendar days; promotional sales such as characterized by the so-called "midnight madness," "truck sale," "tent sale" or "sidewalk sale" shall not exceed 72 hours; and special event sales such as may be permitted in conjunction with a parade, festival, or other such event shall not exceed the specified period approved for such event. No more than one permit per applicant per location shall be issued in any given six-month period for seasonal type sales, and no more than one special event permit per applicant per location shall be issued in any given 60-day period of time for promotional type sales.

C. Application for a permit under the provisions herein shall be examined and approved by the appropriate departments of the city to ensure protection of the public health, safety, and general welfare. In addition to normal concerns of each such department, particular attention shall be given to traffic flow and control, auto and pedestrian safety, and the effect which such use and activity will have on surrounding uses, particularly where the adjoining use is residential.

D. When the city manager or designee deems it necessary, the applicant may be required to post a bond or otherwise provide adequate assurance that the site of the selling activity will be returned to its original or an improved state when the selling activity has ceased.

Sec. 30-5.51. Sales and leasing offices, temporary.

Temporary sales and leasing offices for residential developments are allowed with a permit in any zoning district. A permit shall be issued by the appropriate reviewing authority in conjunction with development plan approval if the development plan meets the following conditions in addition to the other requirements for development plan approval and applicable zoning district and use regulations:

A. The development plan shall indicate the location of the temporary sales and leasing office.

B. The temporary sales and leasing office shall be located in an area approved for impervious area by the development plan for the project.

C. The temporary sales and leasing office shall be fenced off from the remainder of the site where general construction is in progress. The petitioner may propose other design measures to prevent customers from moving into the construction area.

D. The number and location of parking spaces proposed for the temporary use shall be designed so as to avoid backing or stacking of vehicles into the right-of-way.

E. No ground-mounted sign other than the allowable temporary development sign for the main project shall be allowed. However, the temporary use may have one sign not to exceed six square feet directing customers to the sales and leasing office.

F. The temporary sales and leasing office shall meet all state requirements and be approved by the building division.

G. Construction offices may only remain as long as an active site or building permit on the property.

H. General conditions.

1. A building permit for the temporary sales and leasing office shall be obtained from the building division prior to the office being erected. The following conditions shall be met prior to obtaining the building permit for the temporary sales and leasing office:

a. The temporary sales and leasing office shall obtain development approval in accordance with article III.

b. A valid building permit shall be issued for the main project.

2. The temporary sales and leasing office use may only be conducted on a site that has an approved development plan with an active building permit for construction of the main project being marketed under the temporary sales and leasing permit.

3. The office may not be used to lease or sell off-site properties.

4. The office may be used for a period of 12 months or until a certificate of occupancy is issued for 25 percent or more of the approved units or until a certificate of occupancy is issued for a permanent on-site management office, whichever occurs first.

5. Once any of the provisions in subsection 4. have been met, no additional permits or certificates of occupancy shall be issued until the temporary leasing and sales office is removed from the site.

6. Neither the sales and leasing office nor the surrounding area where customers are permitted may be used for storage of building materials or building supplies.

Sec. 30-5.52. Sales for fundraising by nonprofit agencies.

A. The intent of this section is to permit the sale of goods, which may include the use of a building or parcel of land for such sales, by nonprofit institutions such as places of religious assembly, schools and fraternal societies, where such sales are clearly incidental to the primary function of such institution and where such a sale is conducted with or as a special event and for a specified time period.

B. To qualify for permission to conduct such sales, an applicant shall secure a permit from the city manager or designee. Approval of such a permit shall be based upon a consideration of the location, which may be in any zoning district, the type of goods to be sold, and the manner of sale, which shall have been examined and approved by the various departments of the city, particularly police, fire and traffic engineering, to ensure protection of the public health, safety and general welfare. In granting their approval, such departments may suggest such conditions of approval as would be in keeping with their individual responsibilities and the general spirit and purpose of this section and may recommend that approval of such permit be denied where conditions warrant.

C. A permit issued under the provisions of this section shall be effective for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days.

### ARTICLE VI. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

#### DIVISION 1. CONCURRENCY AND TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY

Sec. 30-6.1. Purpose.

This division is intended to implement the Comprehensive Plan, as required by F.S. § 163.3202, by ensuring that development approved by the city shall not result in a reduction of service below the level of service (LOS) standards adopted in the Comprehensive Plan.

Sec. 30-6.2. Implementation of Comprehensive Plan.

A. To implement the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan, the city establishes:

1. A concurrency management system that enables the city to determine whether it is adhering to the adopted LOS standards and its five-year schedule of capital improvements;

2. A regulatory program that ensures each public facility is available to serve development concurrent with the impacts of development; and

3. A transportation mobility program (TMP) as an alternative to transportation concurrency. The TMP is an alternative mobility funding system that is not mobility fee-based.

B. *Annual report on facility capacity.* On an annual basis, the city shall issue a facility capacity report indicating the facility capacity status for each public facility having an adopted LOS standard. The extent of the remaining capacity available for each fiscal year shall be made available to the general public within 30 calendar days of the start of each fiscal year. Gainesville Regional Utilities shall be responsible for determining the water supply and water and wastewater facility capacity status to be included in the facility capacity report, as determined in accordance with Gainesville Regional Utilities' water/wastewater capacity policy.

1. Nothing herein shall preclude amendments to the annual report if deemed necessary to update or correct: Errors in preparation; the impact of issued development orders or permits, monitoring by the city indicates an unacceptable degradation to an adopted LOS standard; or changes in the status of capital improvement projects of the state or any local government that changes the underlying assumption of the annual report.

2. An amended annual report shall not divest rights acquired prior to the amended report, except where a divestiture of such rights is determined by the city commission to be essential to the health, safety or welfare of the general public and otherwise in accordance with law.

C. *Annual capital improvements element update.* As provided in the Comprehensive Plan, the capital improvements element shall be updated annually during the budget review process. The annual report on facility capacity, prepared in conjunction with the budget review process, shall include a forecast of the capacity of existing and planned capital improvements identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements. The forecast shall be based on the most recently updated schedule of capital improvements for each public facility. The city shall also annually revise relevant population projections, update public facility inventories, update unit costs, and update revenue forecasts in cooperation with the office of management and budget, the finance department and Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU). The findings of the city shall be fully considered in preparing any proposed amendments to the Capital Improvements Element, any proposed amendments to the city annual budget for public facilities, any proposed amendments to GRU's annual budget for public facilities, and the review of and issuance of development orders during the next year.

D. *Recommendations on amendments to the capital improvements element, city annual budget and GRU annual budget.* Based upon the city report described above, the city manager and general manager of utilities shall annually propose to the city commission any amendments to the capital improvements element, the city's annual budget and the GRU annual budget for capital improvements made necessary by circumstances described in the report.

Sec. 30-6.3. Level of service standards.

The following level of service (LOS) standards shall be used to implement the concurrency management system and the transportation mobility program:

A. *Transportation mobility.*

1. Roadway LOS:

a. The LOS for all roadways in city limits shall be LOS E, except for I-75 and roadways operating as backlogged or constrained.

b. The LOS for I-75 segments that fall within city limits shall be maintained at LOS D to the extent feasible, recognizing that I-75 serves land areas and traffic outside city limits.

c. The city shall attempt to maintain the 2012 operating LOS on all backlogged and constrained roadways in city limits.

2. Transit LOS:

a. The city shall strive to provide fixed-route transit service within one-fourth mile of 80 percent of all medium and high density residential areas identified on the future land use map, and within the RTS service area.

b. The city shall strive to provide peak hour frequencies of 20 minutes or less within one-fourth mile of all high density residential and UMU-1 and UMU-2 land use areas in city limits.

c. The city shall strive to provide and maintain fixed-route transit service to all existing transit hubs and transit-supportive areas (as mapped in the Transportation Mobility Element Map Series) with peak hour frequencies of 30 minutes or less.

d. The city shall strive to operate 80 percent of fixed-route transit routes for at least 14 hours per day.

3. Pedestrian LOS:

a. The city shall install at least one linear mile of sidewalk annually to retrofit existing areas without sidewalks.

b. Sidewalk construction shall be required for all new development.

c. New streets shall be designed and constructed to include sidewalks.

4. Bicycle and trail LOS:

a. The city shall add an average of at least one mile of bicycle facilities annually, including multi-modal trails.

b. New streets shall be designed and constructed to include bicycle facilities.

B. *Stormwater management.*

1. The LOS standard for all stormwater management facilities shall be the 100-year critical duration storm. The LOS standard for water quality treatment shall be treatment of first one inch of runoff; and compliance with the stormwater management facility design and performance standards established by the applicable water management district to ensure that the receiving water quality standards of Chapter 62-302, Florida Administrative Code are met and to ensure that receiving surface waters maintain their classifications as established in Chapter 62-302 Florida Administrative Code.

2. These standards shall apply to all new development and redevelopment. Any exemptions, exceptions or thresholds in the Florida Administrative Code citations are not applicable.

C. *Potable water/wastewater and water supply.*

1. Potable water.

a. Maximum day (peak) design flow: Two hundred gallons per capita per day.

b. Storage capacity: One-half of peak day volume in gallons.

c. Pressure: The system shall be designed for a minimum pressure of 40 psig under forecasted peak hourly demands to assure 20 psig under extreme and unforeseen conditions.

2. Wastewater.

a. Average day standard: One hundred six gallons daily flow per capita.

3. Water supply. Average daily flow of 147 gallons per capita per day.

D. *Recreation.*

1. Level of service standards for parks.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Park** | **Adopted LOS Standard1** | **Existing LOS2** |
| Neighborhood park | 0.80 acres | 1.33 acres |
| Community park | 2.00 acres | 2.13 acres |
| Local nature/conservation | 6.00 acres | 15.71 acres |
| Total acres per 1,000 people | 8.80 acres | 19.73 acres |

1 Park standards are in acres per 1,000 people.

2 Existing LOS is based on 2011 city population estimate and available facilities.

E. *Public schools facilities.* The uniform, district-wide LOS standards for elementary, middle and high schools shall be 100 percent of program capacity as annually adjusted by the school board. This LOS standard shall apply to all school concurrency services areas (SCSAs) (within Gainesville's city limits) as adopted in the interlocal agreement. For combination schools, the school board shall separately determine the capacity of each school to accommodate elementary, middle and high school students, and shall apply the LOS standard prescribed above for elementary, middle and high school levels respectively.

F. *Solid waste.* The following LOS standard for disposal and collection capacity shall be established: 0.655 tons of solid waste per capita per year disposed (3.6 pounds of solid waste per capita per day disposed).

(Ord. No. 170831, § 6, 4-5-18)

Sec. 30-6.4. Level of service review.

A. *Generally.* It is the policy of the city that no development order may be issued unless adequate public facilities are available to serve the project, at adopted LOS standards. The applicant shall provide information to show compliance with the adopted LOS standards and meeting concurrency requirements. In order to ensure that adequate public facilities are available concurrent with the impacts of development on each public facility, the following procedures govern the issuance of development orders.

B. *Exemptions.* Developments that are issued a certificate of concurrency exemption as further provided in this chapter are exempt from the concurrency requirements of this chapter. In addition, the following types of development fall below the threshold for any concurrency review and are deemed automatically exempt:

1. Single-family dwellings (including expansions and remodeling) on lots of record that existed on or before June 10, 1992.

2. Building permits for two-family dwellings (including expansions and remodeling) that: 1) are on lots of record that existed on or before June 10, 1992; or 2) previously have met the concurrency requirements of this chapter.

3. Concept review of a development as specified in article III of this chapter.

4. Zoning verification letters with no associated change of use as specified in article III of this chapter.

5. Lot splits.

6. Changes to a new use allowed under the applicable zoning district that do not involve adding any new square footage or impervious surface.

C. *Mandatory certification of preliminary development orders.* Prior to the final approval of a preliminary development order, as defined in this chapter, the owner/developer of a project shall obtain either a certificate of concurrency exemption, a certificate of preliminary concurrency or a certificate of conditional concurrency reservation. Renewals of approvals for preliminary development orders shall consider the implications for concurrency management.

D. *Mandatory certification of final development orders.* Prior to the approval of a final development order, as defined in this chapter, the owner/developer of a project shall demonstrate that a valid and unexpired certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of final concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation exists for the project. A project under consideration for a final development order that has a valid and unexpired certificate of preliminary concurrency and that has not been amended in a fashion to change densities or intensities of use shall be automatically granted a certificate of final concurrency. Renewals of approvals for final development orders shall consider the implications for concurrency management.

E. *Succession.* As long as the original certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency, certificate of final concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation remains valid and unexpired, it shall serve all subsequent development permits for that specific project.

F. *Optional review of projects.* Any person may submit an application for a concurrency determination at any time. A concurrency determination reserves no capacity and is in no way binding on the city. Applications for a concurrency determination shall contain sufficient data on the project to prepare a concurrency determination.

G. *Credit for redevelopment, reuse or demolition of existing structure.* If an applicant proposes to redevelop, reuse or demolish a building or part of a building as part of the redevelopment of a property and desires to receive public facility impact credits for that portion of the property being redeveloped, reused or demolished in accordance with this section, application shall be made and approved prior to such action. Construction shall commence within the timeframe established in the final development order to obtain the benefits of the credit. The applicant shall provide sufficient information about the previous use of the structure(s) so that credits can be calculated. Credits are not transferable to any other site. In the case of reuse or redevelopment of a building, full credit shall be provided for the existing square footage of the building even if a change of use occurs. However, any additional square footage added to the building or development shall be subject to concurrency and TMP review.

H. *Applications.*

1. *Submission of application.* Applications for a concurrency determination, certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency, certificate of final concurrency and certificate of conditional concurrency reservation shall be on file in the city. Fees for each type of application are set forth in appendix A (schedule of fees, rates and charges). The application shall consist of such information as needed by the city to determine concurrency status.

2. *Limitation of approval.* A concurrency determination, certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency, certificate of final concurrency and a certificate of conditional concurrency reservation shall apply only to the specific land uses, densities and intensities based on information provided in the application, and, where applicable, the preliminary and final development orders. All applicants, to the extent required by the city, shall submit such applications for entire projects, rather than portions of projects, except in cases of phased developments.

3. *Issuance of certification.* After concurrency review has been completed, the city manager or designee shall either approve or deny the application. If denied, the denial shall be in writing and shall include the reasons for denial. If a certificate of conditional concurrency reservation is approved, the approval shall require the payment of the relevant reservation fee or a bond equal to the amount of the reservation fee for reserving capacity, as specified in the executed development agreement. This fee shall be paid within ten working days of the issuance of the certificate of concurrency reservation or the certificate shall be cancelled. In either case, the final development order shall not be issued until the capacity reservation fee is paid. Public facility capacity shall be granted on a first-come, first-served basis, determined as of the date and time a certificate of preliminary concurrency, certificate of final concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation is issued.

4. *Expiration and effect.* A certificate of concurrency exemption shall be valid for one year. A certificate of preliminary concurrency and certificate of final concurrency shall be valid for the time period that the appropriate development order is valid and unexpired. If either a preliminary or final development order does not have an expiration date, the certificate of preliminary concurrency or certificate of final concurrency shall expire in one year. A certificate of conditional concurrency reservation shall be valid for the time period reserved in the certificate. A new application for a certificate of preliminary or final concurrency shall be submitted if the project does not continue in good faith. A new fee will be assessed for the resubmittal of an application for a certificate of preliminary or final concurrency.

(Ord. No. 200722, § 10, 4-21-22)

Sec. 30-6.5. Standards of review.

The following standards shall be used in review:

A. *Potable water, solid waste, stormwater management, water supply, wastewater and recreation.* Prior to approval of a building permit or its functional equivalent, the city shall consult with Gainesville Regional Utilities to determine whether adequate water supplies to serve the new development will be available no later than the anticipated date of issuance by the city of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent. Concurrency requirements for potable water, solid waste, stormwater management, water supply, wastewater and recreation shall be met by one of the following standards:

1. A final development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place and available to serve the development no later than the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent; or

2. The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement that is secured by a completion bond or other acceptable form of security subject to review and approval as to form and legality by the city attorney. The agreement shall guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place and available to serve the development no later than the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent.

B. *Public schools facilities.* The concurrency requirements for public school facilities shall be met if:

1. Adequate school facilities (elementary, middle, and high school) are in place or will be under actual construction within three years after the issuance of a final development order or its functional equivalent;

2. Adequate school facilities are available in an adjacent school concurrency service area (SCSA) or will be in place or under actual construction in an adjacent SCSA within three years after the issuance of a final development order or its functional equivalent; or

3. The developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation proportionate to the demand for public school facilities to be created by actual development of the property, including, but not limited to, the options described in F.S. § 163.3180(6)(h)2.a.

C. *Project phasing.* In determining the availability of public facilities, an applicant may propose and the city may approve proposed projects in stages or phases so that public facilities needed for each phase shall be available in accordance with the standards set forth in this section.

#### DIVISION 2. SUBDIVISIONS

Sec. 30-6.6. Design standards.

A. *Lots and blocks.*

1. *Generally.* Lots and blocks must be designed according to acceptable practice for the type of development and use contemplated so as to: be in keeping with the topography and other site conditions; provide adequate traffic and utility access and circulation; provide acceptable use of space; and provide privacy, adequate drainage, and protection of property.

2. *Lot frontage.* Each lot in a subdivision must front for the entire required minimum lot width on a public street or an approved private street. Where there is no minimum lot width requirement, each lot must abut a public street or approved private street for a width equivalent to the maximum driveway width required in the Design Manual, plus any required turning radii area. Notwithstanding the above, the length of street frontage may be modified during subdivision review by the public works and planning departments, based on the need to achieve the most efficient lot layout, access to and from the subdivision, operational needs of service vehicles, vehicular circulation and the health, welfare and safety of the public.

3. *Connectivity.* The subdivision must create vehicular and pedestrian access to serve the subdivision and improve gridded connectivity by connecting to surrounding existing streets and by including new streets within the subdivision. Street intersections must occur at least every 1,000 feet. Additionally, subdivisions containing 20 lots or more must provide a minimum of two access points to the extent feasible. Modifications to this requirement may be granted by the applicable reviewing authority where the construction of a street is limited by existing conditions, including:

a. Access management standards;

b. Regulated environmental features; or

c. Public facilities, including stormwater facilities, parks, or schools.

Alternatively, where the applicable reviewing authority determines that it is not possible to construct the streets that would be required to meet the block perimeter standard, the block perimeter must be completed with the provision of pedestrian and bicycle paths or multi-use paths. The required streets or paths must be constructed at the expense of the owner/subdivider according to the appropriate city standards as determined through the subdivision review process, but may be sited and configured in a manner so that the streets provide the most appropriate access to the subdivision and connectivity to the surrounding street network. Where a street or path is planned to provide a future connection to a street or path beyond the extent of the subdivision, the owner/subdivider shall provide for the connection of the street by stubbing out the road improvements as close as practicable to the boundary of the subdivision.

4. *Dimensions.* The size, width, depth, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. Lot dimensions and street abutment requirements shall not be less than the minimum standards established in article IV. Lots in areas shown on the future land use map as single-family or residential planned use district for single-family detached units shall front on a local street, whenever the lots abut a local street.

a. For development sites of five acres or less, located in an area shown on the future land use map as single-family or residential planned use district, the following standards shall apply:

i. The lot size and dimensions shall be generally consistent with abutting/adjacent lots.

ii. The minimum lot width of new parcels shall be no less than 75 percent of the average width of adjacent lots, but shall not be required to be greater than 150 feet and may not be less than the minimum required in article IV. Each lot shall meet this minimum requirement at the front setback line (as opposed to the minimum front yard setback) and the rear property line.

iii. The minimum lot width requirement shall not apply if a 35-foot natural or planted buffer is created as a perimeter buffer around the new development. The perimeter buffer may include stormwater facilities and shall be approved by the city commission during design plat review.

b. The city commission may waive any of the standards listed in subsection a. above for any single lot that is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the required lot size of the zoning district in which the property is located.

5. *Side lot lines.* Side lot lines shall be, as nearly as practical, at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. No lot shall be divided by a municipal boundary.

6. *Double-frontage lots.* Double-frontage and reverse-frontage lots shall be discouraged except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arterials and collectors or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A landscape buffer screen in accordance with the requirements of article III, division 7, across which there shall be no right of vehicular access, shall be provided on lots abutting the traffic arterial.

B. *Streets layout and type.*

1. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan, particularly any neighborhood elements, now in existence or as may hereafter be adopted, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to the provision of wide tree lawns and tree planting to yield shaded streets, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.

2. When an appropriate street network is not shown in the Comprehensive Plan now in existence or as may be hereafter adopted, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing collector or arterial streets in surrounding areas unless topographic, traffic volume or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impractical or undesirable.

3. Each street on the plat shall be designated as one of the following types, based upon the projected traffic count for the street:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Street Type** | **Description of Intended Use** | **Range of Average Daily Trips at Full Development** |
| Minor local street | Local streets are designed to serve the local community. | Less than 800 |
|  | Residences should be designed to front local streets. Local streets should be designed to encourage slow speeds and discourage non-local traffic. |  |
| Major local street | See above. | 801 to 1,200 |
| Minor local collector | Collector streets are designed to carry and distribute traffic between local streets and arterial roadways (see Design Manual). | 1,201 to 3,200 |
| Major local collector | See above. | 3,201 to 7,000 |
| Minor arterial | Arterial streets are routes that generally serve and interconnect major activity centers in the urban area and/or provide connections between cities. | 7,001 to 12,000 |
| Principal arterial | See above. | Over 12,000 |

D. *Traffic count data.*

1. The number of annual average trips per day may be obtained from the city traffic engineer.

2. Trip generation rates shall be calculated by a professional engineer using trip generation rates established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers according to accepted engineering practices approved by the city traffic engineer.

E. *Subdivisions on arterial streets.* Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the provision by the subdivider of marginal access streets, reverse-frontage lots with planting screen contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property lines, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through traffic from local traffic may be required. No lot in any area shown on the land use plan for single-family use or single-family residential PUD at less than eight units per acre shall front on an arterial street.

F. *Design specifications.* Intersection design, intersection sight distance, minimum street design, and cul-de-sac minimum lengths and turnaround diameters shall be designed in accordance with this article and the Design Manual.

G. *Street access to abutting property.* When designated on the official roadway map or determined by the city commission to be needed for proper traffic circulation, access to abutting property shall be provided through the use of a street stub. If such a street stub terminates more than 100 feet from an intersection, it shall be provided with a temporary turnaround that would allow vehicular traffic to turn around safely without having to leave the pavement. Specifications for optional temporary turnarounds are contained in the Design Manual. The developer of the abutting area shall pay the cost of restoring the street to its permanent cross section and extending the street at such time as the abutting area is developed.

H. *Dedication of right-of-way.*

1. Where a proposed subdivision abuts or includes a future transportation corridor alignment or existing transportation corridor that is scheduled for construction shown in the City of Gainesville Comprehensive Plan or the Florida Department of Transportation 5-Year Transportation Plan or the Alachua County 5-Year Work Program, rights-of-way as needed according to the proposed road type shall be dedicated on each side of the proposed alignment for use as a transportation and utility corridor.

2. Where a proposed subdivision or lot split abuts a public right-of-way that does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, as further specified in the Design Manual, the owner(s) may be required to dedicate to the city, at no cost to the city, one-half of the right-of-way width necessary to meet minimum design requirements for street rights-of-way, as specified in this article. If the proposed subdivision abuts both sides of a substandard street, one-half of the right-of-way width necessary to meet those minimum design requirements may be required from each side. The dedication of this right-of-way or any easements necessary shall be accomplished by a separate document. The subdivider shall provide the city with legal descriptions of all easements or rights-of-way to be dedicated, and the city shall prepare and record the necessary documents as part of the approval process.

I. *Alleys.* When provided in any district, alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet.

J. *Bridges.* Bridges shall be constructed in accordance with the Design Manual.

K. *Sidewalks and bikeways.*

1. Where provided, sidewalks and bikeways shall be designed as an integral part of the total on-site and off-site circulation system, including integration or linkage with designated greenways, and shall be located within the street right-of-way or within rear lot easements or common open areas.

2. The installation of sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the subdivider and the sidewalks shall be installed prior to the acceptance of the improvements by the city. The subdivider may elect to postpone installation of sidewalks until such time as building permits are issued for 60% of the subdivision lots, up to a maximum of five years. However, security for the construction of such sidewalks, in the amount of 150 percent of the estimated costs of construction, shall be provided by one of the methods described in article III, division 7. In subdivisions, sidewalks along streets fronting common areas such as stormwater basins, entrance streets, or open space shall be installed within 12 months of final plat approval (acceptance of improvements by the city), and are not eligible for the above-described postponement provisions.

3. The city manager or designee may waive the requirement of installing a streetside sidewalk or modify the sidewalk width requirement to save a heritage tree or a regulated tree deemed by the city manager or designee to have special value to the urban forest. Instead, the sidewalk right-of-way is allowed to be re-aligned or a short narrowing of the sidewalk width is allowed. The city manager or designee can approve either a sidewalk less than five feet wide for a distance less than 15 feet, or may require the dedication of additional right-of-way or easement so that the sidewalk can avoid the tree.

4. Where a previously dedicated street forms a boundary of a subdivision, and where adequate right-of-way for the installation of a required sidewalk does not exist, the subdivider shall dedicate proper sidewalk areas upon the side of the street abutting the lands subdivided and construct the required facilities.

5. Sidewalk construction in accordance with this chapter shall be required for each individual lot in a subdivision created after September 11, 2000, prior to being issued a certificate of occupancy.

L. *Costs of street improvements.*

1. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to install all local and minor collector streets located within a subdivision. When a major collector or a major or minor arterial street is located within a subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to construct the street, but shall only be required to pay a portion of the construction cost, which portion shall be determined by the ratio that the estimated average daily traffic on the street generated by the subdivision lands at full development bears to the total estimated average daily traffic for the street based on full development of its entire service area. The city shall pay the remaining portion of the street construction costs, but the total dollar liability of the city shall be limited to its proportion of the estimated construction costs prepared by the subdivider and approved by the city commission prior to construction. At its option, the city commission may waive the requirement for construction of the major local collector or major or minor arterial and any associated bikeways or sidewalks, in which case the subdivider's only obligation shall be the dedication of the required right-of-way. Also at its option, when the subdivider's portion of the cost of the major local collector or major or minor arterial exceeds 50 percent, the city commission may permit the construction of a half street by the subdivider.

2. When the average daily trips of a subdivision impact an existing minor or major arterial or major local collector street, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to make improvements as necessary to serve the proposed development while maintaining the operating conditions of the affected roadway. These improvements can include, but are not limited to, installation of additional lanes, signalization, associated stormwater management improvements, and the installation of associated bikeway, sidewalk and transit improvements. The city commission may determine the proportional cost of programmed improvements to be allocated to the subdivider.

M. *Flood hazards.* A subdivision plat shall not be approved unless all land intended for use as building sites can be used safely for building purposes, without danger from flood or other inundation. All subdivisions, or portions thereof, located within a flood channel or floodplain shall meet the requirements of article VIII.

N. *Erosion and sediment control measures.* The city may require the subdivider to use grading techniques, subdivision design, landscaping, sedimentation basins, special vegetation cover and other measures to reduce erosion and sediment. The subdivider shall comply with the requirements of the Design Manual concerning erosion and sediment control measures.

O. *Stormwater management required.* A complete stormwater management system, in conformance with this chapter and the Design Manual, shall be provided in all areas of the subdivision for handling stormwater runoff within or across the subdivision lands.

P. *Stormwater management facilities.*

1. Easements for maintenance access shall be granted to the city along drainage basins and along all storm sewers. In some circumstances, additional easements may be required by the city manager or designee for maintenance access only.

2. The design of stormwater facilities shall consider the ease of maintenance over the life of the facility.

3. Any appurtenances placed in the right-of-way or within any publicly dedicated drainage basin, such as fountains, landscaping, lighting features, and signs, shall be the sole responsibility of the homeowners association and shall only be installed with express written approval of the city manager or designee. A maintenance agreement shall be required prior to acceptance of the facility by the city.

4. Trees selected from the Gainesville tree list that are identified as appropriate for stormwater basins shall be planted to meet the requirements identified in section 30-8.6.

Q. *Stormwater management easements.* Easements, rights-of-way, and stormwater management facilities meeting all requirements of article III, division 7, shall be required upon recommendation of the director of public works.

R. *Utilities required.*

1. *Sanitary sewer.* The subdivider shall provide sanitary sewer services to each lot within the subdivision. All sewer lines serving lots within the subdivision shall be installed by the subdivider prior to the paving of the street and should be designed to operate on a gravity flow basis unless otherwise approved by the utility department.

2. *Water supply.* The subdivider shall install a system of water mains as approved by the utility department and connect the system to the public water supply. The installation of the mains and connection to each lot shall occur prior to paving of the street.

3. *Water and sewer systems.*

a. New central water and sewer systems where required shall be designed by an engineer in accordance with the regulations of the utilities department, the state department of environmental protection and the county health department, and with standards established in this chapter. Central water and sewer systems shall be designed and constructed for an economic life of not less than 20 years, and the water system shall be designed in accordance with the fire protection requirements provided in chapter 10 of the Code of Ordinances.

b. Fire hydrants shall be connected to mains no less than six inches in diameter; however, the utilities department may require larger diameter mains for long lines that are not connected to other mains at intervals close enough for proper mutual support.

c. Sufficient storage or emergency plumbing facilities shall be provided to such an extent that the minimum fire flows will be maintained.

S. *Underground utilities.* Provisions shall be made for utility lines of all kinds, including but not limited to those of franchised utilities, electric power and light, telephone, cable services, water, sewer and gas, to be constructed and installed beneath the surface of the ground within residential and non-residential subdivisions, unless the city commission determines that soil, topographical or other compelling conditions make such construction unreasonable or impractical. The subsurface mounting of incidental appurtenances, including but not limited to transformer boxes or pedestal-mounted boxes for the provision of utilities, electric meters, back flow preventers and fire hydrants shall not be required.

T. *Utilities easements.* When they are necessary to serve the subdivision, utilities easements shall be provided, with a minimum width of 20 feet, located along lot lines. The location of the utility easements shall not interfere with the required space devoted to street trees and tree lawns. Additional width may be required for sewer or stormwater management easements. Side lot line easements may be decreased to ten feet in width when serving a single electric, cable TV, gas or telephone utility. Rear lot line easements shall be discouraged, unless they are provided along an alley.

U. *Greenway dedication.* Where a proposed subdivision contains a designated greenway, the appropriate review board shall determine if there is a rough proportionality between the projected impact of the development on traffic and recreational needs and the nature and amount of property in the development encompassing the greenway. If the board finds the necessary proportionality, a right-of-way or public trail easement shall be dedicated to the city for use as a greenway corridor. The dedication shall correspond with the entire length of the designated greenway corridor as it passes through the subject property, and be of sufficient width to comply with design standards as specified in section 30-8.42, pertaining to greenway districts. Such a dedicated corridor may be established for joint use as both a greenway and for required utility or stormwater management facility dedications when such dedications are compatible with the greenway use. In making its determination, the board shall consider the following:

1. Assessed value of the property to be dedicated and proportion to value of entire property;

2. Square footage of property to be dedicated and proportion to area of entire property;

3. Other legal and reasonable uses of property to be dedicated;

4. Impact to otherwise legal and reasonable plans being considered for development of entire property that would be caused by dedication of the property;

5. Estimated increase in transportation demand caused by the development, and estimated amount of automobile trips that would be avoided by having dedication in place; and

6. Estimated increase in recreation demands caused by the development.

V. *Screening walls and landscaping.* Screening separating residential lots from abutting FDOT functionally classified arterial streets and from streets designated by the city commission as arterial streets based on their physical design, moderately long trip length, and existing or anticipated traffic characteristics shall be required in the form of low-maintenance walls, dense plant material or planted earth mounds. Such a screen shall be at least six feet in height and shall be completely in place before required improvements for the subdivision are accepted for maintenance. The responsibility for maintenance of the wall, plant material and earthen mounds shall be conveyed to the neighborhood association established for the maintenance of common property within the subdivision or the subdivider may provide a financial mechanism for such purpose, subject to the approval of the city attorney.

W. *Subdivision entrance islands or medians.* Landscaped islands or medians may be permitted within the right-of-way at all subdivision entrances. These areas shall be landscaped with materials from the Gainesville Tree List. In addition, the landscaped area shall be provided with an irrigation system or a readily available water supply within 100 feet. Maintenance of subdivision entrance identification and landscaping shall be in accordance with article III, division 7.

X. *Permanent development identification signs and structures.* Permanent development identification signs and structures for subdivisions may be located in the public right-of-way provided there is compliance with article IX and with the following restrictions:

1. *Maintenance agreement.* A maintenance agreement between the city and the subdivision or neighborhood organization or the developer placing the sign in the public right-of-way is required. The agreement shall provide that the subdivision or neighborhood organization or developer, including its successor or assign, is responsible for maintaining the sign and the public right-of-way where the sign is located.

2. *Permitted signs and structures with indemnification agreement.* If the subdivision or neighborhood organization or the developer enters into an agreement that is acceptable to the city attorney indemnifying the city from any liability, the city may permit structures such as walls, permanent planters, or one single- or double-sided street graphic containing a maximum of 32 square feet of sign area per side, to be placed at the entrance(s) and located in the city's right-of-way.

3. *Permitted signs with no indemnification agreement.* If the subdivision or neighborhood organization or the developer does not or is unable or unwilling to enter into an indemnification agreement with the city that is acceptable to the city attorney, the city will permit an identification sign on the right-of-way at the entrance(s) to the subdivision pursuant to the conditions in article IX and the following additional conditions:

a. One double-sided sign no taller than four feet in height from the ground may be placed in an entrance median. If made of wood, the sign may be no wider than six inches in width, and, if made of masonry, may be one course thick (unreinforced) and no wider than 12 inches, including letters.

b. Alternatively, two single-faced signs equal in size may be placed within the right-of-way on each side of an entranceway. Unless mounted on a wall, each face of the subdivision sign shall be no taller than four feet from the ground.

c. The sign(s), whether located in a median strip or along the side of the entrance street, shall be located at least four feet behind the face of the median curb.

d. Location and materials of the signs shall meet the requirements of article IX.

Y. *Fire hydrants.* Fire hydrants shall be required in all subdivisions as per plans approved and accepted by Gainesville Regional Utilities and the city fire department.

(Ord. No. 200722, § 11, 4-21-22; Ord. No. 211359, § 8, 10-17-22 Ord. No. 2023-169, § 8, 6-1-23)

Sec. 30-6.7. Cluster subdivisions.

A. *Purpose and intent.* The purpose of this section is to establish a process by which environmentally sensitive land and infill sites may be developed for residential purposes without strict adherence to the dimensional requirements of the zoning code of the city. The intent is to encourage better site planning than would normally occur by conventional subdivision procedures. Specifically, the objectives are to better preserve valuable open spaces, environmentally sensitive areas, existing tree cover; to provide for infill development where appropriate; to provide for better utilization of land; to provide for zero lot line development; to promote efficiency through design; and to provide for design flexibility to meet changing market conditions. Such development will be accomplished without an overall increase in density otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the development is located as determined by the minimum lot size.

B. *Permitted districts; minimum size.* A cluster subdivision may be permitted in any zoning district in which single-family dwellings are allowed as a permitted use and where the parcel to be subdivided has an area of five acres or more.

C. *Approval procedure; design standards; name.*

1. Cluster developments shall be approved in accordance with the procedures established for plats. Further, cluster subdivisions involving attached housing in zoning districts that allow such housing types shall also secure development plan approval in accordance with article III.

2. Design standards for improvements shall be in accordance with the provisions and regulations of this chapter.

3. The name of a subdivision approved pursuant to this article shall be followed by the words "cluster subdivision," which shall become and be made a part of its official name.

4. Application for cluster subdivision will be classified as either environmental or infill based on the following criteria:

a. *Environmental.* Development site contains regulated surface waters and wetlands or regulated natural and archaeological resources, or it is within a planning parcel that includes regulated natural and archaeological resources.

b. *Infill.* Cluster subdivision provides for infill development where appropriate, better use of land, zero lot line development, and/or promotes efficiency through design.

D. *Dwelling types permitted.* Except in the SF zoning districts, all types of attached and detached single-family residential dwellings may be permitted in a cluster subdivision. In the SF districts only single-family detached dwellings will be permitted in a cluster subdivision. Within cluster subdivisions, a variety of lot sizes and architectural typologies shall be encouraged.

E. *Modification of street, yard, and lot requirements.* Modifications to the lot area, lot width and depth, minimum yard setback, street width and layout requirements of the applicable zone may be permitted if shown on the design plat and such plat is approved by the city commission. No cluster subdivision of 50 acres or less in the SF district shall have lot sizes reduced by more than 25 percent of that required by the district regulations. Each cluster subdivision may use zero lot line, regular lots or a combination of the two. However, each lot in a cluster subdivision that directly abuts developed property not in a cluster subdivision shall not have the following, unless the subdivision provides a 35-foot buffer around the entire subdivision:

1. An abutting side or rear yard that is less than that required for the abutting property; or

2. A lot width that is less than 75 percent of the minimum lot width required in the zoning district for the abutting property.

F. *Number of dwelling units permitted.* The total number of dwellings permitted in a cluster subdivision shall not exceed the number of dwelling units that would have been otherwise permitted by the density standards in the zoning district in which it is located. In the SF, RMF-5, and RC districts, the permitted number of dwelling units may be calculated by dividing the total land area of the cluster subdivision by the minimum lot size required for the applicable zoning district. The number of dwelling units shall not exceed the density allowed by the zoning district.

G. *Cluster open space requirement.*

1. Each cluster subdivision that reduces lot sizes below the minimum area required by the zoning district in which it is located shall provide cluster open space to be preserved and maintained for its scenic value, for recreational or conservation purposes and other related uses. This space shall be clearly indicated on the plat by the use of the words "cluster open space." The minimum amount of land to be designated as cluster open space shall be equivalent to 75 percent of the total amount of area by which each lot was reduced below the minimum lot size required in the zoning district plus any required wetland, creeks and associated buffer acreage in which the subdivision is located. Cluster open space is not required unless lot sizes are reduced below the minimum area required in a zoning district.

2. Land area devoted to public or private vehicular streets and sidewalks, rights-of-way, and drainage structures shall not be included towards meeting cluster open space requirements, except when such land is being jointly used for a greenway corridor as specified by section 30-6.6. For the purposes of this section "drainage structures" shall be defined as culverts, storm drains and stormwater retention or detention ponds. Fifty (50) percent of drainage facilities (unfenced) that use existing topography, have side slopes that are stabilized by plantings, provide a recreational or aesthetic amenity, provide environmental quality and ecological value, and use native plants to create an aquatic or a temporary aquatic type of ecosystem to the development, may be included towards meeting cluster open space requirements. Unless otherwise restricted, cluster open space may contain accessory structures and improvements necessary for the educational, cultural, recreational or social enjoyment of the residents or citizens plus any necessary utility services. The appropriateness of accessory structures will be reviewed and considered in terms of their enhancement of the cluster open space, the purposes as provided in subsection A. of this section, and the criteria as provided in subsection I. below. Accessory structures may be approved during the design plat review process, or during the development plan review process subject to the provisions of this section and the provisions of article III. Accessory structures are prohibited within wetlands, creeks, lakes and associated buffers.

3. Environmentally significant features such as but not limited to, creeks, creek setback buffers, wetland, wetland setback buffers, flood channels, floodplain areas, major tree groupings and individual trees of significant size shall be designated as cluster open space. Notwithstanding any contrary language contained in section 30-8.19 or other city regulations, all wetlands mitigation for a cluster subdivision shall be done on site.

4. The cluster subdivision shall strive to protect healthy heritage trees. The restrictive covenants for the cluster subdivision shall require that homes and other improvements are designed to protect the trees.

H. *Ownership of cluster open space.*

1. *Public ownership.* Cluster open space may be conveyed to the city unless the city commission finds that the size, location, nature and type of development, or fiscal impact (i.e., the cost and maintenance of development or open space) would make public use undesirable or unnecessary. Such conveyance shall be by statutory warranty deed free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and shall take place on or before the recordation of the subdivision plat. In some instances, the city commission may authorize the conveyance of the cluster open space by a conservation easement as provided in F.S. § 704.06, when the nature and character of the cluster open space are suitable for such easement. Where the cluster subdivision encompasses lands designated for greenways or other forms of public ownership or access under the recreation; conservation, open space and groundwater recharge; and stormwater management elements of the Comprehensive Plan, the city may require dedication of such areas to the city as specified by section 30-6.6.

2. *Private ownership.* Where open space is not dedicated to the city or public use, it shall be protected by legal arrangements satisfactory to the city attorney sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation for the purpose(s) intended. Covenants or other legal agreements shall specify, at a minimum, the ownership of the cluster open space, method of maintenance, maintenance of taxes and insurance, compulsory membership and assessment provisions; guarantees that any homeowners' association formed to own and maintain cluster open space will not be dissolved without the consent of the city; and any other provisions deemed necessary by the city attorney to meet the requirements of this section.

I. *Criteria for review of cluster subdivisions.* A cluster subdivision shall provide for better use of land and for a total environment, which is improved over that which could be achieved under standard regulations. The applicant shall present evidence that the proposed cluster subdivision uses the land better than a standard subdivision. If the city commission finds that a subdivision will be improved by the reasonable modification of the location, design or configuration of open space, building lots, streets and parking areas, the subdivision will be modified or denied. The following criteria shall guide the city in review of the proposed subdivision and in making any modifications thereof:

1. Individual lots, buildings, streets and parking areas shall be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features and topography. A minimum of 50 percent of all heritage trees shall be protected.

2. Individual lots, buildings and other structures shall be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties and to improve the view from, and the view of, buildings, lots and structures.

3. Individual lots, buildings, streets and parking areas, and any accessory structures and improvements located in the cluster open space, shall be situated to avoid the adverse effects of shadows, noise and traffic on the residents of the site and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicles.

4. Cluster open space shall include any irreplaceable natural features located on the tract such as, but not limited to, stream beds and adjacent banks, wetlands, flood channels, floodplain areas, major tree groupings and individual trees of significant size.

5. The usability of cluster open space intended for recreation or public use shall be determined by the size, shape, topographic and location requirements of the particular purpose proposed for the open space. Further, such space intended for recreation or public use shall be easily accessible to trail users including the elderly and handicapped, be integrated to form unbroken trail linkages between uses within the subdivision, and take advantage of opportunities to establish off-site linkages to nearby land uses, bikeways, sidewalks and greenways.

6. To the extent practical, lands designated for greenways or other forms of public ownership or access in the conservation, open space or recreation element shall be included as cluster open space and dedicated as specified by section 30-6.6.

7. Diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building design shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between the development and the land. Garage doors if forward facing shall be set back at least 20 feet from the back of sidewalk and shall not be forward of the front facade of the building. Sidewalks shall be included on both sides of the street internal to the cluster subdivision.

8. To the extent practical, cluster open space shall contain regulated surface waters and wetlands, and set-asides of regulated natural and archaeological resources.

9. When lots abut wetlands or buffer areas, the property owner shall provide a ten-foot building construction setback from those areas for a construction work area, so that wetlands and buffer areas are not disturbed during any construction process.

(Ord. No. 2024-263, § 13, 10-3-24)

#### DIVISION 3. GENERAL STANDARDS

Sec. 30-6.8. General lot and building requirements.

The following lot and building requirements shall apply in all zoning districts:

A. *Frontage on right-of-way.*

1. *Minimum property frontage.* No building or structure, except as hereinafter provided, shall be erected on a lot or parcel of land which does not physically abut a public street, private street, or approved private street for the required minimum lot width of the district where the same is located. The city manager or designee may designate a private street as an "approved private street" provided it meets one of the following standards:

a. A perpetual ingress/egress easement recorded in the public records of Alachua County that provides legal access to the lot or parcel of land from a dedicated road or right-of-way and which is deemed capable of carrying public safety vehicles; or

b. Property owned jointly or in common by all property owners fronting the private street as shown in the public records of Alachua County that connects to a dedicated road or right-of-way and which is deemed capable of carrying public safety vehicles.

For the purposes of this section, two classes of approved private streets shall be designated by the city manager or designee:

a. Existing private streets that were constructed prior to September 26, 1994; and

b. New private streets that are approved for construction after September 26, 1994.

The city manager or designee shall have the authority to approve or disapprove, for the purposes of erection of buildings or structures, private streets that existed prior to September 26, 1994. All private streets approved for construction after September 26, 1994 shall meet the construction standards for public streets as shown in the Engineering Design and Construction Manual, except in the PD district. In PD districts, the geometric construction standards may be varied as set forth in the planned development ordinance. For the purposes of minor subdivision and lot splits, the approved private street shall also meet the requirements in article III, division 7.

In zoning districts with no minimum lot width requirement, the lot or parcel of land shall abut a public or approved private street for the maximum driveway width dimension requirement provided in the Design Manual plus any required turning radii area.

Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, a single-family dwelling, if it is an allowable use in the district, may be erected on a lot or parcel of land that abuts at least one public or approved private street for at least 25 feet, provided that the minimum lot width for the district in which it is located is met at the required front yard setback line. Provided, further, that any single-family dwelling existing on a lot that does not conform to the provisions of this subsection may be modified, enlarged or extended, and/or an accessory building or structure may be added to a single-family dwelling, provided that such modification, enlargement, extension or addition complies with all the other requirements of the district in which the lot is located.

B. *Minimum setbacks.* Every required minimum front yard setback line will be established by a line parallel to the centerline of the street right-of-way, measured from the street right-of-way line or as described by specific zoning districts. In cases where zoning districts have alternative requirements for establishing or measuring setbacks, those specific requirements will supersede this section.

C. *Overhanging and protruding projections.*

1. Within the DT district, porches or balconies (the "projection") that are supported by columns or posts may project over the public right-of-way line provided all of the following conditions are met:

f. The horizontal distance between the building façade and the supporting column or post must be at least four feet.

g. An unobstructed pedestrian path that is at least five feet wide and meets all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements shall be maintained along the length of the sidewalk in front of the subject property.

h. The projection has received the written approval of the city. At a minimum, this includes review by planning, public works, fire rescue, building inspections, and Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU). The city may impose additional setbacks, conditions, or restrictions as are deemed necessary by the city.

i. If the governmental entity that owns the public right-of-way is not the city, then the written permission of the governmental entity that owns the public right-of-way is required.

j. If the public right-of-way belongs to the city, the property owner shall enter into a license agreement with the city indemnifying and holding harmless the city, its officers, agents, and employees, from any property damage, including loss, and any personal injury, including death, caused in any way by the projection of the porch or balcony over the right-of-way, and containing such other provisions as deemed necessary by the city to protect the interests of the city.

2. Every part of a required yard shall be open and unobstructed from its lowest point to the sky, except for the customary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, open exit stairs, ornamental features and eaves; provided, however, that none of the above projections shall extend into a required yard more than 36 inches; and further provided that none of the above projections shall extend over any public right-of-way, except in the MU-1, MU-2, BUS, and transect zoning districts. Enclosed exit stairs, outside stairways, balconies, chimneys, flues or other projections shall not extend into any required yard.

3. Within the MU-1, MU-2, BUS, and transect zoning districts, structural or ornamental features may project up to six inches over the public right-of-way line. Additionally, bay windows, cantilevered porches, balconies or exit stairs (the "projection") may project up to three feet over the public right-of-way line, provided all of the following conditions are met:

a. The projection maintains a clear height of nine feet above the sidewalk or ground level of the right-of-way. No component of the projection, including the support, may extend below this clear height.

b. The projection does not encroach upon the vision triangle as provided in the Design Manual.

c. The projection is at least four feet from an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the face of the nearest curb.

d. The projection has received the written approval of the city.

e. If the governmental entity that owns the public right-of-way is not the city, the projection has received the written approval of the governmental entity that owns the public right-of-way.

4. In any nonresidential zoning district, marquees, canopies, or awnings may extend out ⅔ of the way between the face of a building and the curb, provided all of the following conditions are met:

a. There shall be a sidewalk in front of a portion of the building where the marquee, canopy or awning is to be placed.

b. The outside edge of the marquee, canopy or awning shall be at least two feet from an imaginary line drawn perpendicular to the curb.

c. The marquee, canopy or awning shall maintain a clear height above the sidewalk of at least nine feet. No support for the marquee, canopy or awning may extend below this clear height.

d. The person requesting the marquee, canopy or awning shall receive written approval from both the city as regards and Gainesville Regional Utilities as regards the site plan.

e. The person requesting the marquee, canopy or awning shall receive written approval from the city traffic engineer and public works department, or, if the right-of-way is not city-owned from the government entity with jurisdiction over the right-of-way.

f. The marquee, canopy or awning shall not encroach into the vision triangle as provided by the Engineering Design and Construction Manual.

g. The property owner shall be responsible for removing the marquee, canopy or awning at the property owner's expense upon notice that a road or right-of-way project requires it to be removed. If the property owner does not remove it, the governmental agency with jurisdiction over the right-of-way shall remove it and bill the property owner for the cost of removal.

h. If the right-of-way belongs to the city, the property owner shall enter into a license agreement with the city indemnifying and holding harmless the city, its officers, agents, and employees, from any property damage, including loss, and any personal injury, including death, caused in any way by the projection of the marquee, canopy or awning over the right-of-way, and containing such other provisions as deemed necessary by the city attorney to protect the interests of the city. The license agreement shall be for a period of one year, and shall be renewable from year-to-year provided the marquee, canopy or awning is maintained in good condition and meets the standards set forth in this section.

D. *Exceptions to height limits.* Place of religious assembly spires, chimneys, water towers, transmitter towers, smoke stacks, flagpoles, monuments, television antennas and similar structures and their necessary mechanical appurtenances may, where permitted, be erected above the height limits established in this chapter; however, the heights of these structures or appurtenances thereto shall not exceed the height limitations prescribed by the airport zoning ordinance in article IV, division 5.

3. Fences and wall shall be constructed in a safe, sturdy, workmanship-like manner.

B. *Fences.*

1. Fences located within a required yard setback, or within five feet of the front property line in districts requiring no minimum front yard, shall not exceed eight feet in height.

2. Fences located outside the required setback may be constructed to the actual height of the principal building on the lot or to the maximum permitted height for accessory structures for the zoning district in which the lot is located, whichever is lesser.

3. Horizontal and vertical support posts shall be placed facing the inside of the fenced area, except where the fence is designed such that both sides are finished with alternating vertical fence supports.

4. Fences that are constructed, in whole or in part, of razor wire or barbed wire or similar materials are prohibited in all residential zoning districts.

5. Chain link, razor wire, barbed wire and wire mesh fences are not allowed within any of the transect zones, except within side or rear yards within U1.

C. *Walls.*

1. The construction of a wall requires a building permit and is subject to the applicable codes and review procedures of the building department.

2. Garden walls that are built along street frontages shall be limited to three feet in height for purposes of security and visibility. Fences and decorative pillars may extend up to five additional feet above the wall, provided that at least 50 percent of the area above three feet is open.

3. *Retaining walls.* Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit or prevent the construction of a retaining wall on any property, provided that such retaining wall does not adversely affect the natural flow of surface water or create any other adverse effect upon adjacent or adjoining properties. However, any application for a retaining wall shall be subject to the approval of the building official before the issuance of a building permit. The building official shall approve applications for retaining walls which are in conformance with this section.

Sec. 30-6.10. Mechanical equipment.

For purposes of this section, mechanical equipment is defined as a heating, ventilation, or air conditioning unit placed outside of a building in addition to any utility-related equipment such as backflow preventers, pumps, transformers and similar equipment required to be installed on a development site. Mechanical equipment shall be located to minimize noise and visual impacts to adjacent property in a residential zoning district or a planned development district with predominately residential uses.

A. Mechanical equipment shall be screened and sound attenuation shall be provided when adjacent to any property in a residential zoning district or a planned development district with predominately residential uses.

B. Mechanical equipment shall not be located between the building and the street unless the utility company determines this to be the only feasible location.

iv. All development shall provide on-site stormwater quality treatment for the first one inch of stormwater runoff, except as provided in subsection e. of this section. Infill residential development within improved residential areas or subdivisions existing prior to November 18, 1991, shall ensure that its post-development runoff will not contribute pollutants that will cause the runoff from the entire improved area or subdivision to degrade receiving water bodies and their water quality.

v. All development shall have on-site stormwater quantity control designed for the 100-year critical duration storm, except as provided otherwise in this section. A detention system shall be provided that will permit a controlled outlet to receiving watercourses. The system shall be designed so that the peak flow of stormwater off of the site, assuming full development, shall not exceed the natural flow from the lands prior to the subdivision or any development, based on the 100-year critical duration storm.

vi. The type, intensity and structural design of any development proposed for a site shall be appropriate to the existing natural topographic characteristics of the site, while recognizing that minimal grade changes are essential to site development. Avoid disturbing steep slopes. Use terracing and diversions when disturbance of slopes is unavoidable. Slopes created by fill for other than landscape or buffering purposes shall be not steeper than three to one and shall be stabilized by vegetation or other approved methods. Excessive erosion of any cut or fill slope shall require remediation by the property owner.

vii. Drainage facilities designed within a closed system shall be evaluated on a site-specific basis with the minimum design criteria being the 100-year critical duration storm event.

viii. All stormwater basins shall be landscaped in such a manner as to promote safety and to integrate the basin with the overall design of the site.

ix. The contour of retention and detention basins should promote aesthetically pleasing site design and increased wildlife habitat.

x. The Design Manual shall include guidelines for the design and operation of facilities that discourage the breeding of mosquitoes.

xi. The design of retention and detention basins shall promote joint uses for habitat, open space, passive recreation, and the establishment and integration of trails.

xii. Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to minimize the need for maintenance in accordance with the Design Manual.

b. *Erosion and sedimentation control.* The city may require the developer to limit clearing and grubbing outside the proposed developed area to the site, control erosion and sedimentation during and after construction, stabilize cleared areas, limit stockpiles, protect stormwater inlets during construction, control construction access routes, remove temporary control systems after construction, and limit the placement of gutters and drains. Wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads, provisions shall be made to minimize the transport of sediment (mud), concrete and other construction materials onto the paved surface (through runoff or vehicle tracking). Materials reaching the paved surface shall be removed from the paved surface at the end of each day. Removal shall be by shoveling or sweeping, and the materials shall be transported to a sediment-controlled disposal area.

c. *Hogtown Creek Basin.*

i. Within the Hogtown Creek Basin, systems shall be designed to retain any increase in volume of runoff over the predevelopment volume for a 72-hour period.

An easement shall be provided between participating landowners. The easement shall be recorded in the public records of the county and submitted to the city prior to the issuance of any development permit. Any development proposed for consideration using an existing or planned master stormwater basin shall provide the calculations and documentation necessary to establish the right to use the facility and that the contribution of stormwater runoff of the proposed development will be within the design parameters of the master basin. A maintenance agreement among all the property owners that conforms to the provisions of this section shall be executed subject to the approval of the city attorney as to form and legality and recorded in the public records of the county.

e. *Off-site stormwater management facilities.* A development may use an off-site stormwater management facility to meet the applicable stormwater quality or quantity standards required by the Design Manual.

f. *Redevelopment of vehicular use area or building.* For the purposes of this section, redevelopment is any demolition or reconstruction of the vehicular use area (excluding resurfacing and restriping) or building. Any proposal for a site on which the proposed redevelopment of building(s) or vehicular use area involves the demolition and reconstruction of more than 80 percent of the area devoted to existing building and vehicular use area shall be considered new development, and shall be required to meet the standards for new development. This determination shall be made by the city manager or designee. All redevelopment of a particular lot or site governed by a final development order shall be cumulative from June 10, 1992. Redevelopment shall conform to the following standards with regard to required facilities:

i. *Less than 4,000 square feet.* Any redevelopment of existing impervious surfaces of a site of less than 4,000 square feet shall only require the continued maintenance of existing facilities, including natural areas that provide storage. No additional stormwater management shall be required, except that all development shall be in compliance with all state and water management district requirements.

ii. *4,000 square feet or more.* Any redevelopment of existing impervious surface of 4,000 square feet or more shall be designed to accommodate stormwater quality treatment for the first one-half inch of runoff from the proposed improvements in the disturbed area.

i. *Closed conduits.* A system of closed conduits (except where open ditches are specifically permitted by the city commission) shall be provided to collect and channel stormwater in such a fashion as to permit the unimpeded use of public roads during a rainstorm of the maximum intensity predicted for the city area at ten-year intervals.

ii. *Flood routing.* A route for stormwater runoff shall also be provided that will function, when the system designed to handle the ten-year, 24-hour storm has reached its capacity, so as to prevent flooding (water over the curb level) and ensure access for emergency vehicles during a ten-year, 24-hour storm event.

iii. *Detention/retention system.* A detention/retention system shall be provided that will permit a controlled outlet to receiving watercourses. The system shall be designed so that the peak flow of stormwater from the subdivided lands, assuming full development, shall not exceed the natural flow from the lands prior to the subdivision and any associated development based on the 100-year critical duration storm.

iv. *Roadside swales.* Roadside swales may be provided in lieu of curb and gutter as long as all the specific requirements of this article and the Design Manual can be met.

v. *Open drainageways.* Open drainageways (ditches) shall not be permitted in or within 100 feet of any residential district or any land in actual use or zoned for use as a school, unless it can be established to the satisfaction of the city commission that the open drainageway will appear and function as a natural watercourse and will not require significant maintenance. Any permitted open drainageway shall be designed so as to present no unreasonable hazard to life, the health of the public and nearby property residents and so as to be protected against scour and erosion.

C. *Acceptance of facilities.* Acceptance of facilities for dedication to the public shall be in accordance with the conditions and procedures pertaining to subdivision review.

6. Approved private streets shall provide a sidewalk having a minimum width of five feet. The sidewalk shall be provided on one side of the street in accordance with standards of the Design Manual. Where five feet of pavement is not possible due to a natural or permanent man-made obstruction, the pavement width may be decreased to a minimum of three feet as necessary to avoid the obstruction. If paving is not possible due to natural conditions, a minimum three-foot wide stabilized pedestrian trail shall be constructed.

7. All proposed minor subdivisions shall meet the level of service standards in the Comprehensive Plan. Proof of meeting these standards shall exist in the form of a certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary concurrency or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation. The approval of a nonresidential minor subdivision in no way reserves capacity for the purposes of concurrency.

C. *Culs-de-sac or dead-end streets.* Culs-de-sac shall not exceed 250 feet, except where alternative emergency service access is available. Where emergency service access is available, dead-end streets or cul-de-sacs shall not extend beyond 1,000 feet. Pedestrian connections shall be provided to these streets in order to shorten walking distances.

Sec. 30-6.18. Sidewalks and shared-use bicycle paths.

A. *Intent.* The intent of this section is to enable pedestrian activity throughout the city, especially as a means to promote pedestrian and transit trips, pedestrian safety and accessibility. Sidewalks are required in conjunction with development orders in every zoning district. This shall apply on any parcel or lot where a roadway is existing adjacent to the proposed development or where there is a reasonable likelihood of mass transit service or a pedestrian need for sidewalks. Sidewalk(s) are required on both sides of all public and private streets, except as otherwise provided in this section.

B. *Schools.* Public and private schools shall meet the design guidelines of Safe Routes to School. Sidewalks and bikeways adjacent to the site shall be extended to appropriate walkways around buildings and bicycle storage areas.

C. Sidewalks are required on both sides of all streets at least five feet in width, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever a sidewalk intersects with a curbed street, ramps shall be installed to facilitate access to the sidewalks by wheelchairs.

1. A shared-use bicycle path shall be provided in a subdivision wherever designated on the officially adopted trail network plan for the city. Also, subdivisions containing a proposed trail network corridor shall provide a shared-use bicycle path and sidewalk system that integrates or links the subdivision with the trail network.

D. *Responsibility for construction.* The installation of sidewalks is the responsibility of the developer/owner and the sidewalks shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the city. For a phased development, sidewalk(s) shall be completed to serve any area for which a certificate of occupancy or any temporary occupancy is required. The developer/owner shall only be responsible for the sidewalk on the same side of the street(s) on which the approved plan is adjacent, except as specifically modified in this section.

E. *Design standard.* Sidewalk(s) and ramp(s) shall be constructed in accordance with the Design Manual.

F. *Payment in lieu of sidewalk construction for single-family/duplex dwelling infill development.* The appropriate reviewing authority may allow an owner/developer to make payment into a designated sidewalk fund in lieu of constructing required sidewalks for infill development of single-family or duplex dwelling(s).

1. Payment in lieu of sidewalk construction is allowable only when the appropriate reviewing authority determines that sidewalk construction is not practical or feasible based on one or more of the following criteria:

a. Construction would result in an isolated sidewalk segment disconnected from the existing or proposed sidewalk system;

b. Construction would result in significant negative environmental impacts to resources including heritage trees, wetlands, or required buffers;

c. Construction would require extensive alterations to existing drainage systems or extensive soil removal or fill; or

d. Construction would require extensive removal or relocation of utilities or other significant physical obstructions.

2. Payments under this subsection must be: 1) calculated based on market cost pursuant to the current FDOT Historical Item Average Cost Report - Statewide 12-Month Moving Average; and 2) collected, administered, and used as part of the city's Transportation Mobility Program Area (TMPA) for the applicable TMPA zone of the subject property, and must be used for sidewalk infrastructure nearest to the subject property to the extent practical or feasible.

3. Payments should be used to improve sidewalk infrastructure in the following order of priority: 1) within the neighborhood from which the fee originates; 2) on the perimeter of the neighborhood from which the fee originates; and 3) within neighborhoods with activity centers that are proximate to the neighborhood from which the fee originates.

G. *Dedication.* In conjunction with the owner/developer's installation of any required sidewalk(s) along a street, the sidewalk shall be constructed within existing right-of-way or, if insufficient space exists within the right-of-way, the sidewalk area shall be dedicated to public use in a form acceptable to the city attorney.

H. *Modifications.* The appropriate reviewing authority may approve modifications from the terms of this section as follows:

1. The appropriate reviewing authority shall require the petitioner to provide information in the form of reports, maps, diagrams, and similar material to support their request for modification.

2. The appropriate reviewing authority may determine the appropriate location or termination of sidewalks, or determine that a portion of a sidewalk may be narrowed to the minimum extent necessary to meet the requirements of this section.

3. The applicant shall demonstrate that conditions and circumstances, which do not result from the actions of the developer, warrant modification of the sidewalk requirements. In reaching its decision, the appropriate reviewing authority shall consider the following:

a. Protection of heritage trees; and

b. Excessive slope or other topographic or geological features.

(Ord. No. 170831, § 7, 4-5-18; Ord. No. 2022-680, § 1, 4-20-23)

Sec. 30-6.19. Access management.

A. *Access to residentially zoned properties.*

1. No residentially zoned land shall be used for driveway, walkway or access purposes to any land that is non-residentially zoned or that is used for any purpose not permitted in a residential district or that is shown on the future land use map of the Comprehensive Plan for solely non-residential use, except for ingress and egress to a use that was existing on October 26, 1981, on land that does not abut a public street.

2. Entrances to dwelling units in the RMF-5, RMF-6, RMF-7, RMF-8 districts shall be 15 feet or greater from any access road or driveway.

3. Minor improvements, such as ramps and landings, that are intended to provide access for a handicapped resident shall be permitted by right within the required yard of any existing single-family dwelling, two-family dwelling and three-family dwelling.

B. *Access to non-residential uses.*

1. Where a parcel of property used for nonresidential use in any business, office, industrial or mixed-use district abuts more than one street, access from either street to such property shall be permitted only if no property in any SF or RC residential district or shown for single-family residential use on the future land use map of the Comprehensive Plan lies immediately across such street from such office-zoned property; provided, however, access may be permitted from any major collector or arterial as shown on the official roadway map; and provided, further, that one point of access shall be permitted in any case, notwithstanding other provisions of this subsection.

2. Access to shopping centers shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article, chapter 23 of the Code of Ordinances, and the Design Manual. Areas used by motor vehicles shall be physically separated from public streets by landscaped buffer areas.

C. *Bicycle, greenway and pedestrian access.* Provisions shall be made to safely incorporate travel ways for bicycle and pedestrian usage into development and redevelopment projects extending to adjacent properties. Where bikeways, greenways or sidewalks are presently adjoining the property, provisions shall be made to safely link the internal bicycle and pedestrian system with adjoining facilities. During development plan review, the appropriate reviewing authority shall also review the relationship of the mixed-use development to adjoining properties and may require appropriate access for bicycles or pedestrians at locations where vehicular access is prohibited.

(Ord. No. 170831, § 8, 4-5-18; Ord. No. 2024-263, § 14, 10-3-24)

Sec. 30-6.20. Driveways.

All driveways constructed or removed within the city limits shall be constructed or removed as provided for in this section and chapter 23 of the Code of Ordinances.

A. *Unauthorized construction, curb-cutting declared unlawful.* It shall be unlawful for any person to construct, cut, break-out or remove any curb along a street or alley except as authorized by the provisions of this article.

B. *Permit.*

1. *Required.* No person shall remove, alter or construct any curb, driveway, gutter or pavement or perform any other improvement on any public street or designated street right-of-way without obtaining a permit authorizing the activity from the appropriate governmental entity (the state department of transportation for roads on the state highway system, the county for roads under county maintenance, or the city for all other roads).

2. *Fees.* Fees for city permits shall be according to the schedule set out in appendix A and shall be paid to the city by the person to whom the permit is issued at the time it is issued.

3. *Posting at site.* The driveway permit shall be posted at the construction site.

C. *Submission of plans; information required.*

1. No driveway permit shall be issued except in compliance with this chapter. In the event that the proposed construction does not require development review under this chapter, then a copy of the plans showing the location and dimensions of all proposed improvements shall be filed with the public works department and the traffic engineering department. Plans are not required for single-family zoned property or single-family uses. All applications for driveway permits shall include information as to whether the driveway will connect to a road on the state highway system or is on a county-maintained street.

2. Additional plans shall be submitted to the state department of transportation or the county for driveways connecting on the state highway system or county-maintained streets. All plans submitted for driveways on the state highway system shall meet state department of transportation submittal requirements including those in Chapters 14-96 and 14-97, Florida Administrative Code as amended from time to time. All plans submitted for driveways connecting on county-maintained streets shall meet the county's submittal requirements.

3. Information required on plans submitted shall include:

a. A complete plot plan showing all proposed buildings and parking layouts, including north arrow and date.

b. Existing and proposed driveway locations and widths.

c. Street pavement types and widths and right-of-way widths.

d. Proposed location of off-street loading and unloading facilities, interior parking arrangements, and traffic circulating patterns.

e. Retaining walls, drainage, utility poles, trees and other physical features that affect the driveway location.

f. Driveways on adjacent properties and/or on opposite side of the street.

g. The state road number, county road number or local road name, the existence and location of any existing and/or proposed public or private roads (proposed public roads as shown in the state department of transportation five-year transportation improvement plan or the city or the county five-year capital improvement plans) abutting or entering the property, and the horizontal and vertical curvature of the roads.

h. Any additional information required by the state department of transportation or the county for roads under their permitting authority.

3. In addition to state department of transportation or state county design standards, all city requirements shall be met unless they are superseded by state department of transportation or county standards. The city design standards and all other city requirements shall be met for all city-maintained streets or alleys.

4. The choice of the proper location for access facilities (driveways) shall involve consideration of the amount of conflict that can be expected both within the parking area and on the abutting streets. One primary concept that shall be followed is to reduce the number of connections to a practical minimum, thus providing fewer locations where conflicts may occur. The city manager or designee may require stub outs to adjacent properties for future cross-access.

5. The area to which the driveway provides access shall be of sufficient size to allow all necessary functions for loading, unloading and parking maneuvers to be carried out on private property and completely off the street right-of-way.

6. Driveways shall be constructed to conform to the existing paved street grade or grade approved by city engineer for nonpaved streets.

7. Parking areas shall be so designed and marked as to provide for orderly and safe movement and storage of vehicles:

a. Back-out parking onto a public street and/or highway shall not be permitted unless in the opinion of the city manager or designee the parking does not present any unexpected hazard to roadway users with respect to roadway design considerations (e.g. visibility, road width, maintenance of utilities, traffic control devices).

b. The minimum distance from the street right-of-way line at any ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking space with direct access to the driveway shall be 20 feet.

c. The minimum distance from the street right-of-way line on any major ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking space having direct access to such driveway shall be 100 feet. A major driveway is defined as the main ingress or egress point to a public street or highway from a site of a major development such as a shopping center, multiple-family development, industrial park, etc.

d. Six-inch standard curb or similar barrier shall be installed along the driveway from the street right-of-way line to the first interior service drive or to and including the first interior parking space described in subsections b. and c. above. Material other than concrete or asphalt curb may be used if approved by the city engineer and chief code enforcement officer or building official.

8. Driveways shall be laid out to intersect the street as nearly as possible at right angles (ninety (90) degrees) and no driveway shall intersect any street at less than seventy-five (75) degrees, unless no other access is possible and the alternate access design is approved by the city traffic engineer. Driveways at or near street intersections or driveways from other sites that cannot be aligned shall be offset no less than one hundred fifty (150) feet from each other. In order for a driveway to be offset less than one hundred fifty (150) feet the applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city traffic engineer that extraordinary need and/or circumstances exist such as insufficient frontage width or existing natural features which preclude driveway installation.

9. Driveways serving major developments, as defined in this chapter, shall not be located closer than 300 feet from the intersection of arterial and/or collector streets. The petitioner shall demonstrate hardship to the city traffic engineer or the city traffic engineer shall determine that special engineering design considerations exist for driveways serving major developments to be located closer than 300 feet to the intersection of arterial and/or collector streets.

E. *Specifications generally; costs for city-maintained roadways.*

1. The public works department shall prepare, maintain and update a Design Manual that provides design and construction specifications for driveways, curb cuts, curbs and other pavement on city-maintained roadways and rights-of-way.

2. All driveways shall be hard-surfaced in conformance with the applicable standards and specifications.

3. Driveways shall cross the sidewalk area at the sidewalk grade established by the city engineer.

4. Driveways shall be constructed as nearly to a right angle to the street or roadway as possible.

5. Where special pedestrian and vehicular hazards may be encountered, driveways may be restricted to a one-way operation. Proper signs giving notice to the restricted use of driveways shall be erected and maintained by the person having control over the driveways. Failure to erect such signs and failure to use such driveways in accordance with the proper signs shall be a violation of this article.

6. All costs of any change proposed in any physical improvements originally installed by the city and all costs of the installation of any driveway or necessary signing shall be borne by the property owner.

7. All costs and responsibilities for maintenance and/or repair of any driveway or related signing shall be borne by the property owner.

F. *Number and location of driveways.* In order to maximize traffic safety and highway capacity, provide reasonable ingress and egress to property, and adhere to the concepts of access management as stated in Florida Statutes and regulated by the state department of transportation, the number and location of driveways shall be regulated as follows:

1. One driveway shall be permitted for ingress and egress to a lot, except:

a. Where joint-use driveways, shared-access or cross-access drives are approved by the development review board or city plan board under development plan review in accordance with this chapter; or

b. Where property zoned and in use for a detached single-family dwelling or two-family dwelling abuts a local street.

2. Two driveways shall be permitted for ingress to and egress from a lot provided:

a. All other requirements of this article are met;

b. The minimum distance between the two driveways equals or exceeds 20 feet as measured from inside edge to inside edge of the driveways at the property line; and

c. The applicant demonstrates to the city traffic engineer sufficient need, such as delivery of emergency services, one-way driveway, physical features unique to the site, and/or loading/unloading requirements, to justify two driveways.

3. More than two driveways shall be permitted for ingress and egress to a lot provided:

a. All other requirements of this article are met and exceptional circumstances exist that cannot be mitigated, in the judgment of the city traffic engineer, unless more than two driveways are provided; or

b. Where the lot meets the following three thresholds:

i. The lot exceeds ten acres in total land area;

ii. The lot has more than 1,000 automobile parking spaces; and

iii. Whenever more than two driveways are permitted, the minimum distance between driveways meets or exceeds 300 feet as measured from centerline to centerline of the driveways at the property line.

4. The number and location of driveways on the state highway system are regulated by the state under Chapters 14-96 and 14-97, Florida Administrative Code, as amended from time to time.

5. If development on any city street impacts the operation of any road on the state highway system, the regulations set forth in Chapters 14-96 and 14-97, Florida Administrative Code, as amended from time to time shall apply.

G. *Driveway types.*

1. All driveways on the state highway system or on county-maintained streets shall meet the relevant requirements of the appropriate governmental entity.

2. All driveways on city-maintained roadways shall be the standard ramp-type driveway construction except that street-type entrances may be permitted from major thoroughfares into the major entrances of planned shopping centers, large industrial developments, apartment complexes and drive-in theaters that have parking areas for 300 or more vehicles.

E. *Location of parking area.*

1. Required off-street vehicle parking areas shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land as the principal structure to be served, or on any lot or parcel of land within 300 feet of the principal structure to be served, or within 600 feet if the structure is located within a transect zone, as measured from the lot line to the nearest point of the off-street parking facility, provided that this provision shall not be interpreted to permit the location of off-street parking spaces within a zoning district where parking facilities are not otherwise permitted.

2. All bicycle parking facilities required by this chapter shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land as the use for which such facilities are required and as close to the building entrance as possible without interfering with the flow of pedestrian traffic.

3. Within the transect zones, a minimum of ten percent of the provided bicycle parking shall be located between the street curb and the front of the building. The remainder shall be located a maximum distance of 600 feet from a building entrance. Within the U9 and DT zones, bicycle parking that is not located along the street shall be covered from inclement weather or located within a parking structure.

F. *Joint use of parking area.* The joint use of vehicle parking facilities of more than five spaces by two or more uses is permitted whenever such joint use is practicable and satisfactory to each of the uses intended to be served and when all requirements for location, design and construction can be satisfied. In computing capacities of any joint use, the off-street vehicle parking requirement is the sum of the individual requirements that will occur at the same time, provided that the total of such off-street vehicle parking facilities required for joint or collective use may be reduced during site plan approval in accordance with the following criteria:

1. That the uses which the joint off-street parking facilities serve do not normally or regularly operate during the same hours of the day or night may be considered; and

2. Not more than 60 percent of off-street vehicle parking facilities required for a use may be supplied by off-street vehicle parking facilities which are provided for other buildings or uses.

G. *Joint use agreement.* A copy of an agreement between joint uses shall be filed with the application for a building permit. The agreement shall include a guarantee for continued use and maintenance of the parking facility by each party to the joint use.

H. *Leased parking facilities.* Required off-street vehicle parking areas may be leased (the "leased area") with boundaries clearly delineated in the lease by the owner or operator of the principal structure to be served, provided the owner or operator enters into a written lease agreement, which shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney, under the following terms and conditions:

1. The leased area is within 300 feet, or within 600 feet if the structure is located within a transect zone, of the main entrance of the principal structure measured to the nearest point of the leased area;

2. The leased area shall be clearly marked with appropriate signage indicating that the area is for the exclusive use of the principal structure, except in a transect zone, wherein the leased area may be jointly used with another principal structure provided the uses in such principal structures do not normally or regularly operate during the same hours of the day or night and otherwise comply with the provisions of subsection F. of this section;

3. The leased area shall comply with, the landscaping section and the design requirements of this chapter;

4. The term of the lease for the leased area shall be a minimum of three years with a minimum one-year cancellation clause; and

5. The lease shall expressly provide that the use of the principal structure is expressly contingent upon the parking facilities of the leased area, and if the lease is terminated for any reason the owner or operator of the principal structure shall immediately cease operations and terminate the use of the principal structure unless and until additional required off-street parking facilities are provided in accordance with provisions of this article.

I. *Assessed parking.* The required off-street vehicle parking for a particular use shall be reduced by its proportionate share of publicly owned public parking for which it has been specifically assessed. The applicant shall acknowledge through an agreement or a statement in the development plan that the city retains the right to remove the on-street parking.

J. *Enforcement.* Off-street parking facilities shall be maintained and continued as an accessory use as long as the principal use is continued. It shall be unlawful for an owner or operator of any building, structure or use controlled by this article to discontinue, change, dispense with, sell or transfer any required parking facilities, including those leased or jointly used, without establishing alternative vehicle parking facilities which meet the requirements of this article. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to utilize a building, structure or use without providing the off-street parking facilities to meet the requirements of this article.

Sec. 30-7.2. Off-street vehicle parking.

Off-street vehicle parking, including public parking facilities, must be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the following standards and regulations:

A. *Access.* Vehicular ingress and egress to off-street parking facilities must be in accordance with the driveway ordinance, chapter 23, article V.

B. *General requirements.* Parking areas must be so designed and marked as to provide for orderly and safe movement and storage of vehicles.

1. All parking spaces must contain some type of vehicle wheel stop or other approved barrier that prevents any part of a vehicle from overhanging onto the right-of-way of any public road, alley, walkway, utility or landscaped area.

2. All parking lots with two or more rows of interior parking must contain grassed or landscaped medians at least eight feet in width unless an alternative landscape plan is approved pursuant to section 30-8.4. Where it is determined by public works that the landscaped median(s) would obstruct the storm drainage, the city manager or designee may approve an alternative.

3. Off-street parking on any property with RC or SF zoning, or planned development (PD) zoning with single-family or two-family dwellings, and that is located within either the University of Florida context area or a residential parking overlay district area will be regulated in accordance with section 30-7.7.

4. Maneuvering and access driveways for off-street parking areas, except those provided for single-family dwellings, must be provided within the lot on which the parking is located so that any vehicle will not be required to back into or maneuver within the public street right-of-way on entering or leaving any off-street parking space.

5. One hundred feet must be the minimum distance from the street right-of-way line at any major ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking space having direct access to such driveway. A major driveway is defined as the main ingress or egress point as approved by the applicable reviewing authority.

6. Twenty feet must be the minimum distance from the street right-of-way line at any other ingress or egress driveway to any interior service drive or parking space with direct access from such driveway. However, the city manager or designee may allow a reduction of the 20-foot requirement, provided generally accepted traffic principles are maintained, under the following conditions:

a. Where an existing vehicular use area would be impractical to meet the 20-foot requirement; or

C. *Construction specifications.*

1. *Paved parking facilities.* Except as provided in subsection 2. below, all off-street parking areas must be paved using asphaltic concrete, concrete, paving block or brick, and must be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications adopted by resolution of the city commission and on file in the public works department.

2. *Unpaved parking facilities.* Unpaved spaces must be located on the periphery of any paved parking areas in locations that will receive less use than those paved and more remotely located to the use served. All gravel areas must be self-contained with curbing that is acceptable to the public works department. The following parking facilities may be unpaved, provided such facilities are approved by the applicable reviewing authority to be in compliance with this section and other applicable requirements of the Land Development Code:

a. Up to 70 percent of the required vehicle parking spaces for places of religious assembly provided that such unpaved parking spaces may not be used as joint parking with any uses other than places of religious assembly.

b. Up to 20 percent of the total required spaces for multi-family dwellings, in accordance with section 30-7.2 C.3.

c. Parking spaces provided in excess of the minimum number required by this article, or for uses not required to provide parking spaces.

d. Parking lots located in the residential districts, as identified in section 30-4.1, when said lots contain ten or fewer parking spaces and parking lots in the office districts when such lots contain less than seven parking spaces.

e. College Park/University Heights areas in accordance with section 30-7.7 B.

3. *Multiple-family dwellings with more than six parking spaces.*

a. If approved in site plan review, up to 20 percent of the total required vehicle parking spaces for multi-family dwellings may be provided by stabilized unpaved parking.

b. Six months after a final certificate of occupancy is issued or, if phased, upon installation of all parking facilities required, an inspection will be made by the city manager or designee. If findings indicate that the unpaved spaces are in good condition or infrequently used, such unpaved spaces may remain unpaved. If findings show that the spaces receive as much use as the paved spaces, or have deteriorated, such unpaved spaces must be paved within 90 calendar days of written notice to the owner of the property.

c. Stormwater management facilities must be provided for all vehicle use areas, whether paved or unpaved, at the time of construction unless the owner demonstrates that stormwater management facilities can be expanded to accommodate future required paving and upon recommendation of the Public Works Department.

d. A violation of the Code of Ordinances occurs if the unpaved parking area deteriorates so that nearby properties, rights-of-way, or easements are adversely impacted or if the unpaved parking area has deteriorated so that it may no longer be used for parking. Evidence of deterioration includes but is not limited to:

i. The settlement of the unpaved parking area(s) such that drainage patterns are redirected onto off-site properties rather than the intended stormwater management facilities.

ii. Absence or failed condition of the approved unpaved parking surface.

iii. Introduction of sediment and debris from the unpaved parking area onto city rights-of-way and easements.

e. To remedy this violation, the city may require the property owner to pave the area or to stabilize the area in another manner. If paving is deemed necessary by the city, the property owner may be required to expand the stormwater management facilities as provided in subsection C.3.c. of this section.

4. *Vehicles and equipment display and storage areas.*

a. When allowed as a permitted use, parking, storage or display of automobiles for sale or lease must be conducted on a paved hard surface.

b. All mechanical equipment and merchandise must be installed or displayed on a paved hard surface.

c. Temporary parking and storage may be allowed by the city manager or designee for up to 60 calendar days in areas outside of the wellfield protection zones. The city shall make a determination that:

i. The location of the facility will not be harmful to, nor impact surface waters, wetlands, or other environmentally sensitive areas;

ii. The nature, extent, and duration of the proposed storage area will not create a nuisance or safety hazard;

iii. That the storage use will be of an intensity that will maintain sod or some other vegetative cover; and

iv. That the applicant has a plan to return the site to an original or improved condition.

D. *Dimensional requirements.* Vehicular parking widths and depths must meet the specifications in the Design Manual.

E. *Handicapped parking.* Accessible handicapped parking spaces must comply with the state accessibility requirements manual on file at the building inspection department.

F. *Tandem parking.* When administered as a valet parking service, required off-street parking may be placed in a tandem configuration upon approval by the applicable reviewing authority. The area used for tandem parking must be clearly designated on a development plan and must meet all landscaping requirements, except that the location of required interior landscaping will be determined at the time of development review. Approval of tandem parking configuration will be based on continued maintenance of the administered parking service. If and when the service is discontinued, the regular off-street parking configuration of aisle and spaces must be reinstituted and the minimum parking spaces required must be provided in accordance with this article. When using this option the property owner shall demonstrate that private streets, vehicular maneuvering areas, service areas, loading and unloading area, queuing areas and any regular parking space can function efficiently and will not obstruct the efficient flow of traffic, service, utility, and vehicles on the site.

Motorcycle parking shall be clearly labeled as such.

Sec. 30-7.5. Required number of parking spaces.

A. *Generally.* The maximum number of parking spaces allowed for each use is as provided in this section.

1. In calculating the maximum number of parking spaces, a fractional space of one-half or more will be rounded up to one space.

2. At development plan review, the approving authority may allow ten additional spaces or up to ten percent greater than the maximum allowed, whichever number is greater, upon presentation of evidence by the owner of the property that the proposed use has a justifiable need for the additional parking spaces. The approving authority may also allow additional spaces above those otherwise provided for in this section upon the property owner's presentation of a parking study demonstrating that:

a. There is minimal impact to the surrounding area.

b. The subject area has high parking demand combined with a current parking inventory that is near or at capacity.

c. Excess parking will not create excessive distances between buildings and sidewalks.

d. Excess parking will be screened and oriented away from street frontages.

b. Proposed developments providing 40 vehicular parking spaces or more must provide off-street motorcycle and scooter parking spaces at a ratio of one space per 40 vehicle spaces.

6. *Relocatable structures.* Any development within an ED district must comply with the parking requirements as set forth in this article, except that off-street parking facilities for relocatable structures are not required to be constructed for three years from the date of placement of the relocatable structure on a lot. However, the construction of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the provisions of this article must be commenced within 90 calendar days whenever any relocatable structure has been on a lot for a period of more than three years. The movement of a relocatable structure from one portion of a school lot to another location, or the replacement of one relocatable structure with another relocatable structure, will not extend the aforesaid time limits prescribed herein.

7. *Overflow parking.* In situations where development proposals contain recreational facilities that are planned for regularly scheduled activities, the reviewing authority may require at site plan review upon advice of the public works department additional parking to be provided as overflow grass parking.

Sec. 30-7.6. Off-street loading and unloading.

A. *Purpose.* In order to prevent undue interference with public use of streets and alleys, every manufacturing, storage, warehouse, department store, variety store, wholesale store, laundry, dry cleaning, dairy, mortuary, and other uses similarly and customarily receiving or distributing goods by motor vehicles must provide loading and unloading space on the premises for that number of vehicles normally at the premises at any one time on an average day of full use.

B. *Loading and unloading space.*

1. Every building housing a use mentioned in this section and having over 5,000 square feet of gross floor area but less than 20,000 square feet of gross floor area must be provided with at least one off-street loading/unloading space, immediately adjacent to the principal building. In addition, one off-street loading/unloading space must be provided for each additional 10,000 square feet of gross floor area or fraction thereof over 20,000 square feet up to 50,000 square feet, plus one for each 25,000 square feet over 50,000 square feet. Where the requirement exceeds five loading spaces, the traffic engineer shall determine whether additional spaces are needed and to what extent. Such space is defined as an area of at least 50 feet in depth, 12 feet in width and with an overhead clearance of not less than 14 feet, exclusive of access, platform, or maneuvering area, to be used exclusively for loading and unloading of merchandise. The exact dimensions of the loading/unloading space(s) are subject to the approval of the traffic engineer.

2. Access to all truck standing, loading, and unloading facilities must be provided directly from a public street or alley and must be so designed that all maneuvering areas are located on the property.

3. Loading spaces required under this subsection must be provided onsite as an area additional to maximum off-street parking spaces and may not be considered as supplying off-street parking spaces.

C. *Loading areas within transect zones.* In order to allow for in-fill development flexibility to better suit space restraints found within denser urban cores of the city, the approving authority will review, determine, and approve loading areas at development review in consideration of the following:

1. Width of streets adjacent to the development;

2. Times of deliveries;

3. Intensity of use;

4. Traffic; and

5. Site constraints.

If a loading area is required, it must be located in the rear of the site incorporated into the building mass, or screened from public view by a wall (up to a maximum of eight feet) and landscaping.

D. *Loading and unloading mid-street parking in urban streets.* For the purpose of this section, urban streets are as defined in the Land Development Code and "mid-street" is defined as five feet from the centerline of a public right-of-way in each direction. A vehicle may use mid-street parking in urban streets for the temporary short-term loading and unloading of goods or supplies, provided the parking of the vehicle does not obstruct traffic and conforms to the following requirements:

1. The vehicle must straddle the center lines, leaving at least ten feet on each side for other vehicles to pass and shall not be positioned so as to prevent or block access from or to any streets, driveways, parking lots, or parking spaces, or to interfere with pedestrian crosswalks or traffic.

2. Mid-street parking is limited to no more than 15 minutes, and may be used solely for purposes of loading or unloading of goods or supplies.

3. The vehicle must be parked at least 30 feet from any intersection and must have the emergency hazard flashers activated at all times.

4. No mid-street parking is allowed between the hours of 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.

5. No mid-street parking is allowed during any special events or when traffic conditions otherwise render mid-street parking unsafe, as ordered by a law enforcement officer.

(Ord. No. 211262, § 1, 11-29-22)

Sec. 30-7.7. Residential parking.

A. *Residential parking.* This section is established to regulate off-street parking on specific property located in the following zoning districts: RC, SF, or in a district containing single-family or two-family dwellings on property zoned planned development (PD).

1. *Purpose and effect.* This section allows residents to take affirmative steps to preserve the character of their residential and single-family neighborhoods and to enhance the public health, welfare and safety as well as the aesthetic value of their property by controlling off-street parking. Furthermore, healthy vegetation with an above-ground network of leaves, shoots, and stems and an extensive fibrous root system below reduces soil erosion and noise, and improves surface and groundwater by filtering rainwater.

This section acts as an overlay, in that the regulations of the underling zoning district and all other applicable regulations remain in effect and are further regulated by the residential parking overlay district standards described in this section. If provisions of this section conflict with the underling zoning, the provisions of this section shall govern and prevail.

2. *Criteria.*

a. The proposed area shall consist of at least 25 compact and contiguous parcels, as defined in this chapter.

b. The area shall not cause the creation of an enclave or peninsula, as commonly defined in annexations.

c. Each boundary of the area shall be one of the following identifiable landmarks: A street, alley, publicly owned right-of-way, platted subdivision boundary, or a creek.

d. No area boundaries shall overlap the boundary of an existing residential parking overlay district or the context area.

e. The area shall consist only of parcels that are in a RC or SF zoning district, or in a district of single-family or two-family dwellings on property zoned PD.

3. *Procedures.*

a. To create a residential parking overlay, a petition requesting imposition of the overlay district on an area that meets the criteria described above shall be submitted to the city manager or designee on forms provided by the city. Each petition shall meet the following requirements:

i. The individual circulating the petition forms ("petitioner") shall obtain the requisite petition form from the city manager or designee.

ii. The petitioner shall be an "owner", as defined in this chapter, of property located within the proposed overlay district area and shall be a signatory to the petition.

iii. The petitioner shall submit to the city manager or designee an accurate, reproducible map of the proposed residential parking overlay district.

iv. Each petition shall contain authentic signatures of at least 60 percent of the fee simple record title owners of the lots or parcels within the proposed overlay district area, exclusive of public property.

v. To be verified by the city, signatures shall be accompanied by the legibly printed name of the signer, the address of the parcel owned by the signer, the parcel number of the parcel owned by the signer, and the date the petition is signed.

vi. Jointly owned parcels are considered owned by a single person, for purpose of the petition, and any co-owner may sign a petition for the parcel. Only one owner of each parcel shall be included in the 60 percent requirement stated above. If a person owns more than one parcel of property within the proposed district area, that person may sign the petition one time for each parcel owned.

vii. Signatures dated more than six months prior to the date the petition is filed with the city are not acceptable.

viii. For a signature to be verified, Alachua County Property Appraiser records shall indicate that the printed name of the petition signatory is consistent with the name of the property owner as listed in the current records of the Alachua County Property Appraiser.

ix. The petition shall clearly and accurately advise each putative signer of the type of restrictions that may be imposed on the property if the overlay district is imposed upon the area.

x. The petition shall clearly and accurately describe the proposed boundaries of the area.

b. When the petition is submitted to the city manager or designee, the city manager or designee shall verify the names and signatures, and shall determine whether the petition meets the criteria of this section.

c. To pay for the cost of verifying signatures, the city shall charge a fee as set forth in appendix A of the Code of Ordinances.

d. If an insufficient number of acceptable owner signatures are submitted, the city shall return the petition to the petitioner and the city shall retain the fee.

e. If a sufficient number of acceptable owner signatures are submitted, the petitioner may apply for the rezoning of the area with the imposition of the overlay district as provided in this chapter for zoning changes (including application fees, public notice, and public hearings before the city plan board and the city commission).

f. Criteria used to evaluate parcels for rezoning. The following criteria shall be used to evaluate the appropriateness of imposing this overlay district on the area:

i. The petitioner shall submit evidence of the impact of off-street parking on the quality of vegetation or runoff within the proposed overlay district area. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, evidence that off-street parking is resulting in a negative impact to the quality of the vegetation of parcels or contributing to a decline in said quality within the proposed area; and

ii. The petitioner shall submit evidence that off-street parking is resulting in a negative aesthetic impact to lots or parcels within the proposed area, or the effect of that off-street parking on the environment of the area.

g. The petition for imposition of the overlay district shall be considered by the city plan board for its recommendation to the city commission. In order to impose the overlay district upon parcels within an area, an affirmative vote of the city commission is required. If the petition or ordinance fails, a subsequent petition for imposition of the overlay district on all or any portion of the area may not be included in a new petition unless at least one year has transpired from the date of submittal of the previous petition for imposition of the overlay on an area.

If a toxic substance is not listed by the ACGIH, verification of safe levels of the proposed toxic material for public health, plant and animal life will be required.

C. *Utility service.* All utility services, including but not limited to those of franchised utilities, electric power and light, telephone, cable services, water, sewer and gas, shall be installed beneath the surface of the ground, unless the city manager or designee determines that the soil, topography and other compelling condition makes it unreasonable or impractical. The subsurface mounting of incidental appurtenances, including but not limited to transformer boxes or pedestal-mounted boxes for the provision of utilities, electric meters, back flow preventers and fire hydrants, is not required.

#### DIVISION 2. TREES AND LANDSCAPE

Sec. 30-8.3. Elements of compliance.

All property within the city shall be subject to the following regulations, except as exempted by subsection B. below. No parcel within the city may be cleared, grubbed, filled or excavated, nor shall any building be demolished, altered or reconstructed in a manner that negatively impacts regulated trees, changes the site plan, site use or increases the impervious surface area except in compliance with this article. Requirements of these sections do not exempt property owners from compliance with any other section of this chapter.

A. *Minimum requirements for landscaped areas.* All areas designed to meet the requirements of these sections shall comply with the following:

1. Street trees shall be provided a minimum rootzone volume of 700 cubic feet, except street trees that share a rootzone volume shall require a minimum of 550 cubic feet. All other required shade trees shall be provided a minimum of 420 cubic feet of rootzone volume. Where existing conditions preclude the provision of the minimum rootzone volume, the reviewing board or city manager or designee may approve a lesser volume that meets the arboriculture needs of the tree within the existing conditions. Underground utility lines shall not be located within the rootzone volume, except for those lines that are four-inch diameter or less, and then only where the utility separation requirements in subsection 2. below are met. Prior to planting, any limerock or construction debris found in this area shall be removed, and rootzone media soil shall be provided to a depth of at least three feet. Shade trees shall be located a minimum of ten feet from a building face or from major architectural features of the building (including but not limited to balconies, awnings, bay windows or porches).

2. A minimum separation requirement of seven and one-half feet is required between new trees and existing or proposed water, wastewater force main, reclaimed water, gas, electric and telecommunications main and service utility lines, to protect against root incursion. A minimum separation requirement of ten feet is required between new trees and existing or proposed wastewater gravity collection mains and laterals. Where feasible, separations should be marginally increased in order to account for inaccuracies in surveying, engineering or construction. Reduced separation distances to three and one-half feet may be allowed at the discretion of the utility company. In these instances the utility company may require one of the following measures to protect the utility lines, in accordance with the standards established by the utility company:

a. Compaction of the soil immediately adjacent to the underground lines to 98 percent proctor density from the utility line to within 12 inches of ground surface;

b. Encasing the utility line with excavatable flowable fill, steel casing, or other acceptable methods;

c. Wrapping the utility line with an herbicide-impregnated geo-textile bio-barrier cloth;

d. Protecting the utility line with structural barriers of cast-in-place or pre-cast concrete panels, steel or high-density plastic sheet-pile barriers; or

e. Steel casing, installed in accordance with standards established by the utility company.

Where an existing tree is to be preserved, trenchless installation shall be required for the installation of underground utilities, using directional boring or jacking-and-boring of a casing pipe throughout the tree root plate.

3. An irrigation system, or a readily available water supply within a distance of 100 feet, shall be supplied for all landscaped areas. An automatic irrigation system shall be provided for development if the total area of impervious surfaces devoted to vehicular use areas exceeds 10,000 square feet. Such irrigation shall promote water conservation by such methods as drip irrigation and/or efficient sprinkler zoning, as well as reducing the amount of irrigation as plants become established. Each required tree shall be served by a drip ring or bubblers or other appropriate means necessary to ensure that the entire rootball is irrigated. The irrigation system shall be designed and located to minimize the watering of impervious surfaces. Successful establishment of trees should occur within one year. After that time, use of the automatic irrigation system may be discontinued. If the required trees die within three years of planting, they shall be replaced in accordance with this article, and replanted trees will require irrigation throughout the next establishment phase.

4. Landscape areas that are not planted shall be grassed or mulched with organic materials. Grassed areas shall be planted with sod that has been certified free of noxious weeds by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry.

5. When a landscaped area is adjacent to or within a vehicular use area, curbing shall be used to protect landscaped areas from encroachment. Parking spaces shall be designed to provide pervious surface for the vehicle overhang area. Shrubs and trees shall be placed away from the wheel stop, so that they will not be encroached upon by vehicles. In lieu of curbing, the alternative means of preventing encroachment shall be shown on the site plan.

6. All required trees shall be selected from the Gainesville tree list. Tree species not appearing on the Gainesville tree list may be planted only with prior approval of the city manager or designee or appropriate reviewing board. Developments which require 16 or more shade trees shall have at least four different high quality shade tree genera. Street tree diversity is to be attained city-wide in order to reduce the effect of loss of street tree species due to insect or disease outbreaks, even though street tree diversity may not be attained on an individual street. The applicant or landscape contractor shall schedule an on-site meeting with the city manager or designee prior to the installation of any trees or shrubs to ensure compatibility with infrastructure and compliance with landscape code requirements.

7. Any landscaped area adjacent to an intersection or driveway shall conform to the requirements for the vision triangle contained in the City of Gainesville Engineering Design and Construction Manual.

8. Trees located near the street shall be planted in locations that meet the clear zone requirements of the city public works department or the maintaining agency.

B. *Exemptions to landscaping requirements.*

1. Lots designed or designated for single-family residential dwellings and the developed portion of any lot over two acres in actual single-family residential use are exempt from the requirements of this section, except as provided in section 30-8.7.

2. Development within the approach and Airport Runway Protection Zone areas as specified on the adopted Gainesville Regional Airport master plan, on file with the director of aviation, Gainesville Regional Airport, is exempt from the provision of required shade trees in areas where federal regulations prohibit shade trees or where shade tree growth can be expected to penetrate airport zone surfaces regulated under Federal Aviation Regulations 14 CFR, Part 77. If permitted, understory trees must be substituted. Trees may be removed from such areas upon filing a tree removal permit accompanied by submission of written authorization from the Gainesville/Alachua County Regional Airport Authority or FDOT to the City Manager's designee. Reforestation is not required in areas where federal regulations prohibit trees or where shade tree growth can be expected to penetrate airport zone surfaces regulated under Federal Aviation Regulations 14 CFR, Part 77. Mitigation will not be required except for high-quality heritage trees, which must be mitigated in accordance with section 30-8.7.

3. Where required shade trees are expected to conflict with planned solar energy generation, developments may compensate for the required trees by relocating them to a designated area or preserving an equal number of existing high-quality shade trees elsewhere on the site. At least 140 square feet must be provided for each new shade tree to be planted, and existing trees must be preserved in accordance with section 30-8.8. These trees must be located so that they can grow to maturity without obstructing the generation of solar energy, and the area where they are planted or preserved must be delineated and noted as a "designated tree area" on the development plans.

C. *Expansions, 50,000 square feet or more.* Expansions of existing developments that contain 50,000 square feet or more shall comply with the following regulations:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Proposed Development** | **Mandatory Compliance** |
| 1. Any expansion which increases the gross floor area of a development by 10% or less. | The expansion area, all areas adjacent to the public right-of-way, as practicable, and all parking spaces directly related to the expansion area. |
| 2. Any expansion which increases the gross floor area of a development by more than 10% but less than 20%. | The expansion area, all areas adjacent to the public right-of-way, and all property within 25 feet, where practicable, plus 25% of the remainder of the development. Removal of asphalt to create street buffers and parking lot islands will be considered practicable. |
| 3. Any expansion which increases the gross floor area of a development by 20% or more but less than 35%. | The expansion area, all areas adjacent to the public right-of-way, and all property within 25 feet, where practicable, plus 50% of the remainder of the development. Removal of asphalt to create street buffers and parking lot islands will be considered practicable. |
| 4. Expansion which increases the gross floor area of a development by 35% or more. | The entire development. |

5. For purposes of this subsection, repeated expansions of property, including the construction or erection of separate buildings or accessory structures, which meet the threshold in the table shall comply with the provisions of this article as provided above.

6. The determination of the exact location of the remainder area which shall be brought into landscape compliance shall be made by the appropriate reviewing board. In determining the exact location of such remainder area, the following factors shall be considered:

a. Buffering incompatible land uses;

b. Improvement to areas of visual or environmental impact;

c. The economic and technical feasibility of landscaping particular areas; and

d. The visibility of landscaping areas from public roads or sidewalks.

D. *Expansions, less than 50,000 square feet.* Expansions of existing developments that contain less than 50,000 square feet shall comply with the following regulations:

1. Expansions of vehicular use area shall meet the requirements of section 30-8.4 for the expanded area and shall also meet requirements for street and use buffers adjacent to the expanded area.

2. Whenever expansion of a developed area, independently or cumulatively, totals 4,000 square feet or more than 35 percent of the gross square footage of the developed area, whichever is less, the entire site shall be brought into compliance with this article. For the purposes of this subsection, repeated expansions or alterations of the property, including the construction or erection of separate buildings or accessory structures, constructed within a period of 36 months, which meet the above threshold, shall comply with the provisions of this article.

3. Any new use of property which alters the use of existing structures from a residential use to a nonresidential use shall be required to meet all applicable landscaping requirements. The city manager or designee shall determine the applicable requirements based on the character and orientation of the proposed mixed use development.

4. The use of property, including outdoor activities and parking, which expands the lot area of any use, when such property adjoins property in actual use as a single-family residence or shown in any single-family zoning district, shall be required to conform with all buffer requirements.

5. Expansions of outdoor storage shall require screening in accordance with the requirements in section 30-5.19.

E. *Minimum submittal criteria.* All landscape plans shall be drawn to scale and have a north arrow, and accurately depict all buildings, pavement, on-site facilities, utilities and lighting systems. The landscape drawing or accompanying development plan shall give the permitted use of adjacent parcels and the total square footage of all pavement on-site. Stormwater basins shall be designated as either wet or dry. A plant schedule shall be provided showing the botanical name, size, spacing and number of all required plant materials. Architectural symbols depicting trees to be installed shall not exceed the scale equivalent of five feet in diameter with a solid line; a hatched line around the solid line shall show the expected canopy dimension after 20 years as identified in the Gainesville tree list. Any native tree or shrub may be substituted for the identified plant with city staff approval, provided that the tree or shrub is adaptable to the amount of sun/shade, wet/dry and size conditions where it will be planted, and insofar as the provisions for diversity, shading and/or screening described in the article are met. Changing tree species shall not diminish the total number of high quality shade trees in their required locations. Plant material shown in addition to the required elements of the landscape plan may be labeled as optional and shall not be subject to inspection.

F. *Design principles and standards.* All landscaped areas required by this article shall conform to the following general guidelines:

1. The preservation of structurally sound native trees of high quality shade tree species and shrubs is strongly encouraged to maintain healthy, varied and energy-efficient vegetation throughout the city, and to maintain habitat for native wildlife species. Developments should be designed to preserve existing high quality heritage trees, especially those located within 20 feet of the public right-of-way.

2. The landscaping plan should integrate the elements of the proposed development with existing topography, hydrology and soils in order to prevent adverse impacts such as sedimentation of surface waters, erosion and dust.

3. The functional elements of the development plan, particularly the drainage systems and internal circulation systems for vehicles and pedestrians, should be integrated into the landscape plan. The landscaped areas should be integrated, especially to promote the continuity of on-site and off-site open space and greenway systems, and to enhance environmental features, particularly those features regulated by the environmental overlay districts (article VIII).

4. The selection and placement of landscaping materials should maximize the conservation of energy through shading of buildings, streets, pedestrian ways, bikeways and parking areas. Where possible, shade trees should be planted along internal sidewalks that connect buildings to the street sidewalk and to other buildings on the site.

5. Landscaping design should consider the aesthetic and functional aspects of vegetation, both when initially installed and when the vegetation has reached maturity. Newly installed plants should be placed at intervals appropriate to their expected function as short-term or long-term elements. The natural and visual environment should be enhanced through the use of materials which achieve a variety with respect to seasonal changes, species of living material selected, textures, colors and size at maturity.

6. The placement of trees around buildings should permit access to the building by emergency vehicles.

7. The installation of the following invasive nonnative species is prohibited, as is installation of any species labeled as "Prohibited" in the most recently published version of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Science (IFAS) Invasive Species Assessment:

8. For all new development, or redevelopment of existing property, the applicant shall remove invasive nonnative plant species listed on the Florida Prohibited Aquatic Plants List or the Florida Noxious Weed List from the property in accordance with the management plan prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. On property with invasive nonnative plant species, a plan shall be submitted with the development application that includes a timeline, success criteria, treatment recommendations, and identifies methods that will have minimal impact on non-target species. All herbicide applications to control invasive, nonnative plants in wetland or upland set-aside areas (including buffers) shall be applied by a contractor licensed by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Agricultural Environmental Services, with a current certification in Natural Areas Weed Management. The city manager or designee should inspect such sites for a minimum of three years after completion to verify effectiveness of control efforts. The plan shall state the entity responsible for additional treatments during the three-year follow-up if the populations of invasive nonnative plants rebound and cover more than ten percent of any previously infested area within the wetland or upland set-aside areas.

9. Loblolly and slash pines should be at least 25 feet apart post-development to reduce southern pine beetle infestation outbreaks.

(Ord. No. 170974, § 14, 2-21-19)

Sec. 30-8.4. Vehicular use areas.

A. *Perimeter requirements.*

1. *Perimeter landscaped area required.* All vehicular use areas shall be separated by a perimeter landscaped area, a minimum of nine feet in width, from any public or private street and from any adjacent properties.

2. *Exemptions.* This landscape area is not required:

a. When the paved ground surface area is completely screened from adjacent properties or streets by intervening buildings or structures; or

b. When an agreement to operate abutting properties as essentially one contiguous parking facility is in force, and both sites are in compliance with vehicular use area landscaping requirements. The agreement shall be executed by the owners of the abutting properties, and shall bind their successors, heirs and assigns. Prior to the issuance of any building permit for any site having such a contiguous parking facility, the agreement shall be recorded in the public records of the county;

3. *Automotive sales uses.* For automotive sales uses, the perimeter landscape area shall only be required for 300 feet along each street frontage in the area devoted to automobile display, with the remainder of the required plant materials being proposed for planting elsewhere on the site, such as around stormwater areas or the building foundation. Perimeter landscape areas shall be required for all storage, accessory service and customer parking areas at any auto sales facility.

4. *Modifications.* The appropriate reviewing authority may determine that:

a. Screening is better achieved by relocation of the landscape strip;

b. There is an unresolvable conflict between other elements of the development plan and the location, width or height of the perimeter landscape area, and that the public interest is therefore best served by relocation of the landscape area, lowering the height of required material or the substitution of a solid fence or wall in conjunction with a reduction in width provided that the number of shade trees that would have otherwise been required are planted elsewhere on the development site; or

c. On redevelopment sites where the conflict between existing utility line separation distances and the shade trees required within the perimeter landscaped area cannot be resolved through the practices listed in section 30-8.3.A.2., then the area shall be planted with shrubs and understory trees acceptable to the utility company. On projects where new utility lines are planned, sufficient space shall be allocated to meet both the utility separation requirements and the minimum tree-planting requirement.

5. *Required plant material.* The perimeter landscape area shall contain:

a. Shrubs, arranged to provide a visual screen of 75 percent opacity and achieve a height of at least three feet within three years; and

b. High quality shade trees at a minimum average of three trees for every 100 feet of the linear distance of the perimeter landscape area, excluding the width of driveways that cross the landscape area. The distance between such trees shall not exceed 55 feet nor shall they be planted closer than 25 feet apart.

c. The development review board or city plan board during development plan review, or staff during administrative review, may determine that natural vegetation is sufficient to screen adjacent properties and rights-of-way. In such instance the existing vegetation, including understory plants and bushes, is protected from pruning and removal except that diseased plant material and invasive nonnative species shall be replaced in accordance with this section. Where the property is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way or utility easement, these areas shall not be substituted for the perimeter landscape area or the required landscaping. Where encroachments are made for utility connections, replacement plants appropriate to the ecosystem shall be required.

B. *Interior landscaped areas.* The interior of any vehicular use area shall also be landscaped in compliance with the following:

1. Landscape islands, equal to the size of one parking space, shall be located at an average of every ten parking spaces. At no time shall a row of parking have landscape islands greater than 126 feet apart or closer than 36 feet apart. Additionally, terminal landscape islands containing a tree shall enclose each row of parking spaces.

2. Each required landscape island shall contain at least one high quality shade tree listed on the Gainesville tree list as a species appropriate for "lot" planting. Such tree(s) shall be located within the landscaped area to maximize the shading of the pavement.

3. All parking lots with two or more rows of interior parking shall contain eight-foot-wide landscape strips between the rows allowing for two-foot vehicle overhangs on each side. Shade trees shall be planted every 50 feet on average within these landscaped areas, but outside of the two-foot vehicle overhangs. As an alternative, every other row of head-to-head parking may provide a 16-foot-wide curbed landscape strip with shade trees every 35 feet on average. As needed, these wider landscape strips may contain sidewalks.

4. The development review board or city plan board through development plan review, or staff when only staff review is required, may allow the relocation of interior landscaped areas to preserve existing trees, or where it is determined, upon review and recommendation of the city manager or designee, that the relocation is necessary for the safe maneuvering of vehicles or pedestrians.

5. In those vehicular use areas including but not limited to auto dealerships, storage of service or delivery vehicles, or attendant parking where interior landscaping would interfere with the customary storage or display of vehicles, the development review board or city plan board through development plan review, or staff when only staff review is required, may allow some or all of the required interior landscaping to be located near the perimeters of the paved area, including such perimeters which may be adjacent to a building on the site. Such landscaped area would be in addition to required perimeter landscaping in the amount of one square foot of landscaped area for each 60 square feet of paved area. For each 140 square feet of relocated landscaped area, a high quality shade tree shall be provided.

Sec. 30-8.5. Compatibility buffers.

This section is intended to provide the minimum requirements for separation of land uses of differing type and intensity. The need for a buffer strip between land uses shall not impede the development of appropriate pedestrian and bicycle accessways between these uses. Where such accessways are installed, they shall be landscaped in a manner to clearly delineate such trails and bikeways and also to provide shade trees as appropriate. Where certain uses or combinations of uses are difficult to categorize, as in planned developments or public service facilities, it is the intent of this section that buffering shall be provided which mitigates the impacts of such uses.

A. *Required buffer strip areas.* Buffer strips between properties are intended to provide visual screening and sound attenuation of more intense land uses from abutting less intense land uses. The required buffer type, shown in Chart A below, depends on the land use designation of the subject property which is being developed and the land use designations of the abutting properties. The required width of the each buffer type and the required amount of shade trees, understory trees, and shrubs are shown in Chart B below:

**CHART A. LAND USE BUFFER TYPES**

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **BUFFER TYPE** | **MIN. WIDTH** | **SHADE TREES (per 100 linear feet)** | **UNDERSTORY TREES (per 100 linear feet)** | **SHRUBS (per 100 linear feet)** |
| A | 9' | 2 | 2 | 20 |
| B | 9' | 3 | 2 | 20 |
| C | 15' | 3 | 3 | 25 |

B. *Buffer widths.* The appropriate reviewing board, or the city manager or designee, may require the expansion of the minimum width of the buffer strip to ensure that trees will meet separation requirements from utility lines, buildings, or paved areas, or to allow for the inclusion of an existing high-quality shade tree in the buffer strip.

C. *Driveways and sidewalks.* The widths of driveways and pedestrian or bicycle facilities that cross through a required buffer shall be subtracted from the linear feet of buffer length for the purposes of calculating the number of required plantings in Chart B above.

D. *Existing trees and natural vegetation in buffers.* Any regulated, high quality shade trees existing within the minimum required buffer width shall be protected in accordance with section 30-8.8. Credit for preserving existing trees shall be applied in accordance with this article. High quality heritage trees within buffer areas should be preserved with the area underneath the canopy dripline protected. Sidewalks and bicycle access infrastructure may be permitted within the protection zones of a high quality heritage tree but not within the root plate. Natural vegetation, if it achieves a continuous 75 percent opacity for 10 months of the year, may be substituted for the required shrubs. If a buffer that preserved existing vegetation is subsequently cleared by the property owner or when permits for tree removal are granted post-development, then the required shrubs and trees in accordance with this section shall be required.

E. *Invasive nonnative vegetation in buffers.* All buffers shall be maintained to remove invasive nonnative plant species and curtail natural regeneration of seedling loblolly and slash pines. The density of loblolly and slash pines in a natural buffer should be managed so the remaining pines grow no closer than 25 feet and seedling regeneration is curtailed.

F. *Sound attenuation.* The reviewing board, or city manager or designee, may address the need for sound attenuation of certain equipment, such as refrigeration units, motors, fans, power tools, etc., or uses such as loading, vehicle repair, outdoor recreation, etc., by requiring a study, prepared by a licensed engineer or architect, to address the potential for a noise disturbance to be transmitted to adjacent properties by the proposed use, and may require the installation of a wall, fence or berm in addition to required landscape material. The wall, fence or berm may be located within the required buffer or directly around the equipment or use which requires sound attenuation.

G. *Street trees.* Street trees shall be planted along the sides of all streets within a development and on the development side of any contiguous street. Street trees shall be planted for every 30 to 50 feet of street frontage, depending on the canopy area needed for the tree species. The widths of driveways along a street shall be subtracted from the linear feet of street frontage length for the purposes of calculating the number of required street trees. In no case shall trees be spaced closer together than 25 feet or farther apart than 60 feet. Alleys are exempt from this requirement for street trees.

1. Street trees shall be high quality shade trees and shall be planted in tree lawns with a minimum width of eight feet, or within tree wells with minimum four-foot by four-foot surface openings.

a. On-street parking spaces may be located between street trees, as long as the required number of trees is planted along the street frontage and the minimum rootzone volume is provided for each tree.

b. Tree wells may be enclosed with pavers or other hardscape materials above the required rootzone volume. The city manager or designee may determine if installation of an aeration system is necessary to conduit water and oxygen to the roots of trees within tree wells.

2. Where possible, street trees shall be planted between the street and the public sidewalk. Street trees may be planted between the sidewalk and adjacent buildings only where the location of existing or proposed utility lines along the street, or the clear zone requirements of the public works department or other maintaining agency, prevent the location of trees between the street and sidewalk. Where street trees are approved to be planted between the sidewalk and adjacent buildings, the trees may be located as close as five feet away from building face.

3. The reviewing board, or the city manager or designee, may require the adjustment of the prescribed build-to line in order to accommodate the required street trees and ensure that the trees will meet separation requirements from utility lines, buildings, and paved areas.

4. Where possible, developments shall be designed to preserve as street trees any existing champion or high quality heritage trees which are located in the right-of-way or on private property within 20 feet of the right-of-way. Where these trees are preserved, no new construction or grading shall occur within the tree root plate, and new buildings shall be designed so that no more than 25 percent of the crown of the trees is removed. The area underneath the canopy of the preserved trees shall be exempt from tree planting requirements, and the required distances between street trees may be modified.

5. A minimum ten-foot separation shall be provided between street trees and street stormwater inlets, except where bioretention inlets that incorporate trees are utilized.

6. Where the required street trees would overlap with trees that are required to satisfy perimeter landscaping requirements for vehicular use areas, only the requirements for the vehicular use area shall be met.

H. *Parking structures along a street.* Except at points of ingress and egress, and except as required in article IV for transect zones, parking structures shall provide a ten-foot-wide landscaping strip between the public sidewalk and the structure, which is designed to screen automobiles from pedestrians on the street. This strip shall be planted with evergreen shade trees at an average of four trees for every 100 feet of the linear distance of the street frontage of the structure, excluding the width of driveways. The required trees shall be supplemented with a continuous line of shrubs. This landscaping strip is required when the ground floor use is parking, but is not required where parking structures are shielded from the street by liner buildings or provide office or commercial uses along the first floor street frontage.

Sec. 30-8.6. Stormwater management areas.

A. All stormwater basins shall be designed and landscaped to meet the following criteria:

1. Shade trees shall be planted at an average of one tree for every 35 linear feet of the basin perimeter. Spacing of trees may be closer when trees are planted in groups for aesthetic effect, but the minimum distance between the trees shall be ten linear feet. Trees shall be selected from the Gainesville tree list that are appropriate for use within stormwater areas, and all landscaping shall be selected according to the function as a wet or dry basin. Trees shall be located at least 20 feet away from inflow and outflow structures. Bioretention swales and exfiltration facilities are exempt from these tree planting requirements.

2. Twenty-five percent or more of the basin perimeter or littoral zone shall be landscaped with shrubs, groundcover, native perennials, or aquatic plants.

B. Individual stormwater basins that are greater than 5,000 square feet in total area shall be designed with curvilinear sides that mimic a natural wetland, lake, or stream. The landscaping for these basins shall be integrated with the other required site landscaping.

C. Individual stormwater basins that are greater than 40,000 square feet in total area shall also be designed to meet at least one of the following criteria:

1. Provide a recreational or functional pathway for pedestrians or bicyclists and an aesthetic focal point such as a water feature or pedestrian structure; or

2. Be designed to preserve and incorporate a significant tree or tree grouping; or

3. Be designed to maintain an existing wetland function or to preserve or establish habitat for native animal species.

Sec. 30-8.7. Permits for tree removal; mitigation.

A. *Removal or relocation permits.* Except as provided below, no living regulated tree may be removed or relocated without a removal permit and mitigation as provided for in this section. Only the tree advisory board may approve or deny the removal, relocation or replacement of champion trees.

B. *Exemptions.*

1. On property with single-family dwellings, permits shall be required only for the removal of champion or heritage trees.

2. Developments in which 100 percent of housing is affordable to low-income households may mitigate for removal of high-quality heritage trees through inch-for-inch replacement rather than payment of the tree appraised value. For purposes of this section, "low-income households" means those that make less than 80 percent of the Gainesville area median income adjusted for family size, and "affordable housing" means housing where the total monthly cost of that housing including taxes, insurance, and utilities is less than 30 percent of the household's total monthly income.

3. Removal of loblolly or slash pines less than 20 inches in diameter from a natural or naturalized landscape shall not require mitigation planting, unless the removals result in a uniform tree density on the site of less than one tree per 900 square feet of unpaved area. Where resulting tree density would be less, sufficient mitigation trees meeting the standard of section 30-8.10 shall be established to achieve the specified minimum density.

4. Removal of regulated trees in connection with ecosystem management or restoration on parcels with conservation easements, in conservation management areas or on parcels managed as nature parks or preserves, provided the following criteria are met:

a. A plan for the removal and revegetation of the area has been approved by the city manager or designee;

b. The only trees that may be removed are of the following species: Loblolly Pine, Slash Pine, Water Oak, Laurel Oak, Sweetgum, Sugarberry, and any species not native to Alachua County;

c. The tree removal is being done in furtherance of restoration of a natural community or communities appropriate to the site as indicated by soils, remnant vegetation, and hydrological and geological conditions;

d. The applicant has demonstrated that after the removals, the land will be maintained in a manner that promotes the continuation of the restored natural community; and

e. The plan has been approved by the nature centers commission.

5. For the immediate protection of the health, safety, or welfare of the public, trees may be removed without obtaining a permit in advance. However, the property owner or its authorized agent shall file a permit application during the next city work day. Permit approval shall be granted, provided the trees removed are mitigated in accordance with this code.

C. *Methods of mitigation.* Mitigation is allowed by two methods: 1) mitigation trees (on an inch-for-inch basis or as otherwise specified); and 2) mitigation payment. The amount of mitigation is as specified in subsections D. and E. below.

1. *Mitigation trees.* Mitigation trees shall be of high quality shade species as identified on the Gainesville tree list and sited in accordance with the requirements of section 30-8.3.A. The installation of new trees for a development as required by this chapter may count as mitigation for trees removed from the site, except where those removed trees are of a high-quality species. Increasing the diameter of trees required to be planted with a development shall not be used to meet mitigation requirements. The preference is for mitigation trees to be planted on the site, but where it is demonstrated that no space is available, mitigation trees may be planted offsite within city limits as approved by the city manager or designee.

2. *Mitigation payment.* Mitigation payment shall be based on tree appraised value, or as otherwise specified in this code. Payment shall be made prior to the approval of a final development order, or prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for any development requiring only building permits. Mitigation payments received by the city shall be deposited in the city tree mitigation fund, which must be used in accordance with this subsection.

a. *Offsets for tree mitigation payment.* A tree mitigation payment may be offset by installing improvements that create an improved growing environment for existing or proposed trees located within the project's street tree landscape zone within the public right-of-way, including:

i. Use of a pre-manufactured, modular structural product to suspend and support paving over the root zone volume area of the tree in order to prevent soil compaction.

ii. Provision of root zone volume greater than the required minimum as specified in section 30-8.3.A, provided that the root zone volume does not exceed six feet in depth. Credit will be granted per cubic foot over the required minimum up to 2,000 cubic feet total root zone volume. Trees must be provided with a minimum of 1,000 cubic feet of root zone volume to be eligible.

Proposed improvements and installation methods must be consistent with industry standards, and must be approved by the city arborist or urban forestry inspector prior to installation and inspected and approved prior to any credit towards the project's tree mitigation payment. The requested offset may not exceed the project's total tree mitigation payment, and proposed improvements must be used on the project requiring tree mitigation. Improvements must be installed by a qualified installer of the product as identified by the manufacturer's specifications.

b. *Use of tree mitigation funds.* The intent of the tree mitigation fund is to benefit the public and properties that contribute to the tree mitigation fund by expanding improving, preserving, and managing a healthy and sustainable urban forest. Tree mitigation funds may not be used to plant or establish new trees required by this chapter for development or redevelopment and may not be used for routine landscape maintenance on public rights-of-way. Tree mitigation funds may be used for any of the following uses:

i. New tree and native landscape planting and establishment on city-owned property, including purchase of trees, irrigation supplies, mulch, equipment staking materials, fertilizer, and innovative or engineered tree planting materials or techniques.

ii. Structural pruning of trees on city-owned property in accordance with industry standards.

iii. Preservation of tree canopy, with an emphasis on preserving high quality trees, through the city's purchase of conservation lands and associated acquisition costs including survey, fencing, appraisal, and invasive vegetation control.

iv. Site preparation, planting, land management, invasive vegetation control, or natural regeneration of the city's urban forests.

v. Ecological inventory or assessment of the urban forest every five years and updating the urban forest management plan every ten years.

vi. Arboriculture, landscape architecture, engineering, and other professional services directly related to the development of the city's urban forest.

vii. Purchase and supply of trees for planting in the city, including on private property, with a priority on replacement of invasive vegetation and establishment of high quality trees.

viii. Reasonable miscellaneous costs necessary for or directly related to the uses allowed herein or expanding, improving, preserving, and managing a healthy and sustainable urban forest.

D. *Removal and mitigation of regulated trees subject to subdivision or development plan approval.* When tree removal or relocation is contemplated in conjunction with any development requiring approval of a development plan or subdivision plat, such removal or relocation shall be considered and either approved or denied at the same time a development plan or plat is approved or denied, based upon the criteria specified in subsection F. of this section. No separate tree removal permit is required. All of the required plans, data or other information required with the application shall be included on the proposed development plan or on the supporting documents submitted with the plan or the plat. The following requirements apply:

1. Decisions on tree removal shall be based on a tree survey or a qualitative tree survey. The landscaping plan shall show all trees to be preserved, provide for protective tree barriers that meet the requirements of section 30-8.8, and specify the details of the mitigation required in this section.

2. Construction drawings shall be submitted to the building department and application for building permits made before any trees are removed.

3. Subdivisions must be designed to maximize preservation of high-quality heritage trees. The owner/developer shall avoid or minimize removal of high-quality heritage trees by implementing practicable design alternatives including, but not limited to:

a. Limiting the scope, degree, or magnitude of the proposed project;

b. Exploring alternative on-site locations to avoid or reduce impacts to heritage trees;

c. Designing open-space common areas to incorporate high-quality heritage trees;

d. Configuring lots to include high-quality heritage trees along the sides of the lot, rather than in the center where removal is necessary for construction; and

e. Preserving trees along roadways as street trees.

4. After a certificate of occupancy has been issued for a development, any additional tree removal shall require either a tree removal permit or a development plan amendment. Failure to obtain a tree removal permit before removing or relocating any existing regulated tree or any tree that was planted to comply with the approved development plan shall be subject to the measures for enforcement specified in section 30-8.43.

5. The requirements for mitigation of regulated trees approved for removal as part of development plan or subdivision plat review are as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **CATEGORY** | **MITIGATION** |
| High quality heritage trees, in fair or better condition. | Mitigation payment based on tree appraised value, limited to three trees per acre averaged over the entire site. If more than three trees per acre in this category are located on the site then the trees with the highest tree appraised value throughout the site shall be used to calculate the payment. High quality heritage trees proposed for removal in excess of the overall average of three per acre shall require mitigation trees on an inch-for-inch on a diameter basis. |
| High-quality heritage trees in 100 percent affordable housing developments as defined by section 30-8.7.B.2.; heritage trees of other than high quality species, in fair or better condition, excluding laurel oaks and water oaks. | Mitigation trees on an inch-for-inch diameter basis. |
| Any heritage trees in less than fair or better condition; any heritage laurel oak or water oak; and any other regulated tree. | Mitigation trees consisting of two trees of high quality shade species established for each tree removed. |

E. *Removal and mitigation of regulated trees not part of subdivision or development plan approval.* Any person desiring to remove or relocate a regulated tree, except tree removal approved as part of subdivision or development plan approval, shall file a tree removal permit with the city manager or designee. As a condition to granting a permit, the applicant shall mitigate each tree being removed. The following requirements apply:

1. Permit applications shall include the name of the property owner, address from which tree will be removed, tree species and diameter, and reason for removal of the tree. The permit application shall be signed by the property owner and, if applicable, its authorized agent. Applications for tree removal shall also include a scaled drawing of the site showing tree size and location, and a statement of how any other regulated trees are to be protected during any approved tree removal and any associated construction or clearing, or grade changes. The city manager or designee shall attempt to verify the information contained in the application and shall either approve or deny the application as to each regulated tree proposed to be removed.

2. Where construction is associated with the tree removal, construction drawings shall be submitted to the building department and application for building permits made before any trees are removed.

3. The requirements for mitigation of regulated trees not associated with development plan or subdivision plat review are as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **CATEGORY** | **MITIGATION** |
| **Single-Family Dwellings** | |
| High quality heritage trees, in fair or better condition, wherever they are located on the property. | Mitigation trees on an inch-for-inch diameter basis, with a minimum of two shade trees of high quality species planted on site for each tree removed. |
| Heritage trees of other than high quality species and high quality heritage trees in less than fair or better condition, wherever they are located between the property lines and legal setbacks. | Mitigation trees consisting of two shade trees of high quality species planted on the site for each tree removed. |
| **All Other Uses** | |
| High quality heritage trees, in fair or better condition. | Mitigation payment based on tree appraised value, and mitigation trees consisting of a minimum of two shade trees of high quality species planted on site for each tree removed. |
| High-quality heritage trees in 100 percent affordable housing developments as defined by section 30-8.7.B.2.; heritage trees of other than high quality species, in fair or better condition; and high quality heritage trees, in fair or better condition, which are causing structural problems to buildings or underground utilities. | Mitigation trees on an inch-for-inch diameter basis, with a minimum of two shade trees of high quality species planted on site for each tree removed. |
| Any heritage trees in less than fair or better condition; and any other regulated tree. | Mitigation trees consisting of two shade trees of high quality species planted on the site for each tree removed. |

F. *Permit approval criteria.* Removal or relocation of a regulated tree may be approved by the reviewing board, city manager or designee based upon one of the following findings, which shall be supported by competent substantial evidence provided by the applicant:

1. The tree poses a safety hazard or has been weakened by disease, age, storm, fire or other injury;

2. The tree contains a disease or infestation that could spread to other trees;

3. The tree prevents the reasonable development of the site, including the installation of solar energy equipment or the installation or replacement of utility lines;

4. The tree is causing or is likely to cause structural damage or problems to buildings or underground facilities due to excessive root or trunk growth, or soil expansion and contraction caused by uneven water uptake; or

5. The tree should be removed for some other reason related to the public health, safety or welfare. This finding cannot serve as the sole basis for removal of high quality trees.

The city manager or designee may require the applicant to provide verification of the findings in the form of a written report signed and sealed by an appropriate licensed professional within the State of Florida. Regulated trees shall not be removed, damaged or relocated for the purpose of installing, replacing or maintaining utility lines and connections unless no reasonably practical alternative is available, as determined by the city manager or designee. Where a tree may be preserved by cutting the tree roots instead of removing a tree, that strategy shall be preferred.

G. *Natural emergencies or disasters.* In the case of natural emergencies or disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, floods or other disasters, issuances of permits for the removal of damaged trees may be waived by the city manager or designee. Such waiver may not be for an indefinite period and shall expire when the city manager or designee determines that emergency conditions have ended.

H. *Commercial tree removal permits.* Commercial tree removal permits may be granted for the removal of trees associated with forestry management, tree harvest and other similar commercial purposes in accordance with the requirements of this subsection.

1. *Applicability.* Commercial tree removal permits may be requested in lieu of other tree removal permits required by this section where no development of the property is intended. Where development of the property is planned, the petitioner shall address tree removal within the development plan review or normal tree removal processes.

2. *Permit granting authority.* The city manager or designee or the development review board have authority to grant commercial tree removal permits as described below.

3. *Receipt of request.* Owners of property may request the appropriate authority to grant a permit for the commercial removal of trees by filing such an application with the city, on forms supplied by the city, together with the appropriate fee. The request shall be accompanied with the following information supplied by the applicant:

a. Suitability of the trees for harvest.

b. Harvesting methods to be used.

c. Sedimentation and erosion control measures to be used.

d. Plan of property showing location of required buffers next to water bodies and property lines and tree canopy to remain as applicable.

e. Tree protection measures for trees to remain.

f. Species of trees to be used for replacement.

4. *Notice.* Whenever a property is under consideration for a permit, except any property designated agriculture on the future land use map, all owners of property adjacent to the property shall be given notice by mail. Such notice shall be mailed at least 15 calendar days prior to the granting of the permit. For the purpose of this notification, an owner of property shall be deemed to be the person who, by his/her address, is so shown on the tax rolls of the city. If any such property is part of the common area of a condominium, notice shall be sent to all of the condominium unit owners as shown on the latest tax rolls. Additionally, the property under consideration shall also have a sign posted at least five calendar days prior to the date the permit is to be granted. The sign shall specify that the property is under consideration for a permit allowing tree removal for commercial purposes and specify the date the permit is to be granted.

5. *Procedure for review.* If less than 20 percent of the noticed property owners file a written objection to the proposed tree removal within 15 calendar days of the mailing of the notice, the commercial tree removal permit may be issued provided all other provisions of this section and this chapter have been met.

a. If 20 percent or more of such noticed property owners file a written objection within 15 calendar days of the date of mailing of the notice, the development review board shall hold a public hearing in accordance with its rules. The development review board, in deciding whether to approve or disapprove the application, shall consider the factors delineated in subsections H.7. and 8. of this section.

b. Parcels designated agriculture on the future land use map. All applications for tree removal on such parcels shall be reviewed by the city manager or designee, who, in deciding whether to approve or deny the application, shall consider the factors delineated in subsections H.7. and 8. of this section. Appeals of the decision of the city manager or designee shall be made in accordance with provisions for appeal as provided in this chapter.

6. *Action on application.* Upon receipt of a completed application and following the notice period specified above, or after the permit has been granted after a hearing under subsection H.5., the city manager or designee will issue the commercial tree removal permit, except as may be modified below, with the following conditions:

a. Unless otherwise specified herein, trees will be removed according to best management practices, as specified in "A Landowner's Handbook for Controlling Erosion from Forestry Operations," published by the state department of agriculture and consumer services, division of forestry, or subsequent manuals on file with the public works department.

b. No regulated tree shall be removed and no logging road shall be constructed:

i. Within 35 feet of the break in slope at the top of the bank of any creek;

ii. Within 35 feet of the landward extent of a lake or wetland; or

iii. Within a designated conservation management area.

This requirement may be waived where crossing of the creek by a bridge is necessary to access the property where trees are to be removed. Such waiver shall be limited to the area necessary to construct the bridge. For the purposes of this subsection, creeks shall be those identified by the surface water district provisions of article VIII.

c. Following removal of the trees granted by the permit, the petitioner shall within 18 months provide for reforestation of the site by one of the following means:

i. Where forestry or other agricultural use of the property is to continue in the conservation or agriculture districts, pine seedlings or other forestry or agricultural crops, including pasture, may be planted.

ii. Where forestry use is to be abandoned or in districts where it is not a permitted use, replacement of trees shall be required as per this article. This requirement may be waived when an adequate number of trees of appropriate size and species remain on-site to meet this requirement and are certified by the city manager or designee to be in good health and free from damage caused by harvest operation which may result in the death of the tree.

d. All invasive nonnative tree species listed in section 30-8.3 may be required to be removed from the property.

7. *Imposition of additional conditions.* The city manager or designee or development review board, as appropriate, may impose other reasonable conditions where need is demonstrated. Such conditions may include restrictions on percentage of canopy removed or the prohibition of tree removal from certain portions of the site under consideration. The city manager or designee, or development review board, as appropriate, shall be guided by, but not restricted to, the following criteria in imposing such additional conditions:

a. The need to provide buffers to adjacent developed property;

b. The need to protect soils highly susceptible to soil erosion as identified by the soil survey of the county;

c. The need to protect slopes in excess of ten percent, particularly near creeks and other bodies of water;

d. The need to protect existing wetlands, floodplains and flood channels and other environmentally sensitive areas as shown on existing maps, photographs and other reliable and available sources; and

e. The need to preserve endangered, threatened or special concern animal and vegetative species, habitats and communities, rare hardwood hammocks or champion trees as identified from competent sources.

8. *Removal of trees specifically planted or managed for harvest.* Where environmental and other factors limit the removal of trees on 75 percent or more of the site under consideration, the commercial tree removal permit may be denied. However, factors identified above may not be used to unduly prohibit the harvest of trees where it is demonstrated that the trees to be harvested were specifically planted for that purpose.

(Ord. No. 170971, § 3, 2-21-19; Ord. No. 190293, § 1, 10-15-20; Ord. No. 2023-407, § 1, 5-18-23)

Sec. 30-8.8. Tree preservation during development and construction.

A. *Barriers required.* Prior to clearing, demolition, or other construction activities, the city manager or designee or reviewing board shall determine which trees, if any, require protection. Protective barriers shall be constructed, as necessary, to prevent the destruction or damaging of regulated trees that are located within 50 feet of any construction activity or storage of equipment and materials. Trees identified for preservation which are destroyed or severely damaged shall be mitigated in accordance with section 30-8.7 prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or use. To avoid conflicts between barrier placements and demolition and construction activities, barriers shall be drawn to scale on the demolition, grading and paving sheets of the development plan.

B. *Barrier zones.* All regulated trees in areas of demolition or construction that have not been permitted nor designated for removal by either the terms of the permit or approved development order shall be protected by barrier zones erected and inspected prior to construction of any structures, road, utility service or other improvements. Barricades shall comply with the following:

1. Protective barriers shall be plainly visible and shall create a continuous boundary around trees or vegetation clusters in order to prevent encroachment by machinery, vehicles or stored materials. To further protect tree roots, a layer of wood chips at least eight inches thick shall cover the soil within the barricade. Barricades shall be at least three feet tall and shall be constructed of either wooden corner posts at least two by four inches buried at least one foot deep, with at least two courses of wooden side slats at least one by four inches with colored flagging or colored mesh attached, or constructed of one-inch angle iron corner posts with brightly colored mesh construction fencing attached. High quality heritage trees shall be protected by galvanized chain link fencing a minimum of 48 inches high, 11.5-gauge wire, two and three-eighths inch mesh size secured with one and seven-eighths inch line posts no further than ten feet apart secured at a depth of three feet below soil line. Corners shall be secured with two and three-eighths inch line posts secured to a depth of four feet below soil line.

2. Barriers shall be placed at the greater of the following:

a. At or outside the dripline for all heritage and champion trees and all regulated pine and palm trees;

b. At a minimum of two-thirds of the area of the dripline for all other regulated species; or

c. At the tree root plate.

3. If complying with the above placement of barriers is found to unduly restrict development of the property, the city manager or designee, or the appropriate reviewing board may approve alternative barrier placements or methods of protection provided that at least 50 percent of the area under the canopy dripline remains undisturbed (no grade change or root cut) and further provided that there shall be no disturbance to the tree root plate. Protective barriers may not be removed or relocated without such approval.

4. No trenching allowed within the protective barrier zone. Hand dig to install utility if approved by city manager or designee. Where roots greater than one inch in diameter are damaged or exposed, they shall be cut cleanly and re-covered with soil within one hour of damage or exposure.

5. Protective barriers shall remain in place and intact until such time as landscape operations begin. If construction needs dictate a temporary removal (for less than 24 hours), the city manager or designee, may approve or deny the temporary removal of protective barriers.

6. Landscape preparation in the protected area shall be limited to shallow discing of the area. Discing shall be limited to a depth of four inches unless specifically approved otherwise by the city manager or designee.

7. No building materials, machinery or harmful chemicals shall be placed within protective barriers, except short-duration placements of clean fill soil that will not harm the tree. Such short-duration placements shall not exceed seven calendar days. The city manager or designee shall be notified of the dates the short duration placement will begin and end. The original soil grade that existed within the protected areas prior to the placement of such fill shall be restored.

8. The American National Standards Institute A-300 Part V: Management of Trees and Shrubs During Site Planning, Site Development, and Site Construction or other nationally recognized arboricultural standards approved by the city manager or designee shall be used as guidelines for tree protection, planting, pruning and care during development and construction.

C. *Preservation generally.* Trees may be preserved on development sites in locations where a new tree would be required. Credit for the preservation of such a tree will be given if the requirements listed below are met. During construction, if the requirements are not being met and/or the preserved tree is unlikely to survive in satisfactory condition, the owner shall apply for a tree removal permit in accordance with the requirements of this code.

1. Fifty percent of the area within the dripline of the tree shall be naturally preserved, both above- and below-ground. Under no circumstances shall permission be given for any construction activity within the tree root plate. The 50 percent protection zone shall include the entire tree root plate. Landscape materials are permitted within the 50 percent protection zone but not within the tree root plate. Within the 50 percent protection zone there shall be no alteration to the existing grade, no trenching or cutting of roots, and no storage of materials or fill. No heavy equipment shall be permitted within the protection zone. All work shall be done by hand. There shall be no compaction of the soil, as from heavy construction equipment, and no concrete, paint, chemicals or other foreign substances placed within this protection zone.

2. The city manager or designee may approve paving blocks within the protection zone, provided that all work is done by hand (no machinery), and that the soil area under the pavers is not compacted beyond the bulk density limits of 1.40 g/cc in clay, 1.50 g/cc in loam, or 1.70 g/cc in sand. No lime rock or other material shall be used underneath the pavers. Pavers may not be placed within the tree root plate.

3. There shall be no evidence of active insect infestation potentially lethal to the trees and no damage from skinning, barking or bumping.

4. The root plate of regulated trees within the public right-of-way should not be impacted by adjacent development, even where the tree root plate encroaches on the private property. The installation of new utilities or improvements to public utilities required to serve the development should not require the removal of trees on the public right-of-way, where the required separations from the utilities can be met.

5. If any preserved tree is not alive and healthy three years after the certificate of occupancy is granted, it shall be removed and replaced with the tree or trees which originally would have been required by this code. The area that was preserved to accommodate the preserved tree shall be maintained in an unpaved condition and the replacement trees established in this area.

6. The city shall maintain, and make available to the public, descriptions and illustrations of tree preservation and protection practices which will assist in assuring that preserved trees survive construction and land development.

D. *Inspections.* The city manager or designee shall conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and/or during clearing, construction and/or post-construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this section.

E. *Denial; conditions.* The reviewing board or city manager or designee may deny a proposal for development because one or more champion or high quality heritage trees have not been preserved or adequately protected, or may require special conditions of approval that may include but are not limited to the following:

1. Requiring the trees to be protected with chain link barricades.

2. Requiring a soil aeration system in the vicinity of tree roots as needed, particularly where fill will be added over roots of preserved trees or where compaction may reduce the availability of water and oxygen to tree roots.

Sec. 30-8.9. Installation and maintenance of landscape materials.

A. *Installation.*

1. *Quality.* All plants shall be Florida Nursery Grade Number 1 or better, according to the Florida Department of Agriculture Division of Plant Industry Grades and Standards for nursery plants. They shall be healthy, disease-free and pest-free, and hardy for the North Florida region. Nursery invoices or labels shall clearly specify that Grade Number 1 or better plants were purchased for installation.

2. *Tree size.* Trees must have a minimum height of seven feet and a minimum trunk caliper of two inches. Trees must be in minimum 30-gallon containers or field-grown material and must have a ball diameter of at least 28 inches. Trees must have healthy root systems that have been pruned according to the Florida Grades and Standards best practices. Tree species must be selected from the Gainesville tree list with estimated size at maturity at least as large as the tree being replaced.

3. *Tree planting and mulching specifications.* Trees should be planted in holes at least twice the diameter of the rootball. The final level of the newly planted tree should place the root-trunk union between .5 and 1.5 inches above grade. Mulch should be no deeper than one inch over the top of the rootball. A tree ring to hold water in place should be constructed to overlap the meeting of the edge of the rootball and surrounding soil. This tree ring and an area one foot outside it should be covered with four inches of mulch.

4. *Utility and landscaping compatibility.* Lighting fixtures, transformer boxes, fire hydrants, power, cable television or telephone lines, sewer or water pipes, or any other existing or proposed utility facilities and associated appurtenances, shall be located and designed to provide adequate service in the presence of landscape materials when such landscape reaches maturity. Reasonable efforts shall be made to install utility service without impacting existing trees. Excavation to install utility services shall remain at least five feet outside the root plate of any existing high quality heritage tree. Lighting fixtures shall be located a minimum of ten feet from all required shade trees. No shade tree that exceeds 40 feet in height at maturity shall be placed within 15 feet of any overhead utility. Fire hydrant connections and building fire connections shall not be obstructed by plant material, nor shall dangerous plants such as Spanish bayonet be located within 15 feet of such facilities. Small, low-growing shrubs (ten inches or less in height) may be planted to soften the visual impact of these facilities, provided that the necessary access to such facilities is maintained.

5. *Native trees.* At least 75% of trees on the required landscape plan should be native species. Cultivars of native trees are considered native species.

6. *Environmental suitability.* The use and location of all landscaping materials shall be compatible with the soil and light needs of the proposed plant material. At the time of the required pre-purchase on-site inspection with the city manager or designee, substitution of plant species may be approved due to environmental unsuitability of the specified plant materials or due to existing infrastructure conditions on the site. If changes will occur for more than 25 percent of the trees on the site, then the changes shall be red-lined on the plans on file with the community development and building inspections departments. Tree substitutions should be for trees that reach the same maximum height at maturity.

7. *Water conservation.* The use of grass, lawn, or turf shall be minimized to conserve water. All sod shall be inspected prior to purchase and installation and shall be certified as free of noxious weeds by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry. All landscaped areas not covered with vegetation shall be covered with organic mulches. No plastic surface covers shall be used.

B. *Replacement of dead material.* All trees planted in compliance with an approved development plan or as mitigation for the removal of regulated trees shall be maintained in good health. Within six months of a determination by the city manager or designee that a required tree or plant is dead or severely damaged or diseased, the tree or plant shall be replaced by the owner in accordance with the standards in section 30-8.9. If replacement trees die repeatedly, the city manager or designee may require that additional high quality shade trees be planted on the site.

C. *Pruning.* All trees may be pruned to maintain shape and promote their shade-giving qualities and to remove diseased or dying portions in areas where falling limbs could be a hazard to people or property. Tree pruning shall be done in accordance with the most current version of the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations "Tree. Shrub and Other Woody Plant Maintenance" (ANSI A300) and "Pruning. Trimming. Repairing. Maintaining, and Removing Trees, and Cutting Brush —Safety Requirements"(ANSI Z133). No more than 25 percent of the crown should be removed at one time. On young trees, limb removal shall leave no more than 33 percent of the trunk bare of branches. So that shade trees can grow with sturdy structure, the top branch or leader shall not be removed. Hooks shall not be used to climb trees unless the tree is being taken down. Mature trees overgrowing vehicular use areas shall be pruned to allow the passage of emergency vehicles. Excessive pruning, pollarding, or pruning of trees into round balls of crown or branches, which results in an unnecessary reduction of shade and promotes weak branch attachments is prohibited. If the city manager or designee finds same additional shade trees shall be required to be planted on the site on up to an inch-for-inch basis.

#### DIVISION 3. NATURAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES

Sec. 30-8.11. Generally.

A. *Purpose and intent.* Natural and archaeological resources within and around the City of Gainesville provide environmental and social benefits and functions, such as water quality improvement, flood storage and attenuation, erosion control, biological diversity, and groundwater recharge, along with recreational, aesthetic and educational opportunities for people. It is the purpose and intent of this section to:

1. Protect, conserve and restore natural and archaeological resources, and their environmental functions, which are of aesthetic, ecological, economic, educational, historical, recreational, or scientific value to the city and its citizens;

2. Preserve the ecological values and functions of significant natural communities, in order to maintain and enhance the diversity and distribution of native plant and animal species, especially for species listed for protection by state and federal agencies;

3. Conserve, enhance, and manage the ecological integrity of natural systems that have aesthetic, ecological, economic, educational, historical, recreational, or scientific value due to the interrelationships within the ecosystem and its natural communities, and among the populations of species within the communities;

4. Promote connectivity and minimize fragmentation of natural systems, and to protect wetlands, floodplains, and associated uplands in a broad systems context through resource-based planning across multiple parcels rather than by individual parcel;

5. Provide a greater degree of protection for strategic ecosystem resource areas in recognition that the larger resource areas within strategic ecosystems provide the broadest range of benefits, functions, and values listed above;

6. Provide protection for Floridan aquifer high recharge areas, and for archaeological and geological resources, which are significant due to the interrelationships of natural or cultural resource values, characteristics, or due to unique hazards or vulnerabilities posed by developed land uses;

7. Avoid loss or degradation of such benefits and functions, to minimize unavoidable degradation or loss of benefits and functions and to require sustainable mitigation that fully offsets any unavoidable loss or degradation of such benefits and functions; and

8. Ensure that development activities that cause the unavoidable degradation or loss of benefits or functions provided by these resources are clearly in the public interest before approval of same.

B. It is unlawful for any person to adversely impact any natural and archaeological resource regulated under this chapter without first obtaining the required natural and archaeological resources review and approval in accordance with these regulations. In addition to the regulations set forth in these sections, there may be other regulations within the City Code of Ordinances and the Alachua County Code of Ordinances that are applicable, including but not limited to:

1. Water quality code - Chapter 77, Alachua County Code.

2. Hazardous materials management code - Chapter 353, Alachua County Code.

3. Wellfield protection zone - City Land Development Code.

4. Surface waters and wetlands - City Land Development Code.

5. Landscape and tree management - City Land Development Code.

6. Historic preservation/conservation - City Land Development Code.

7. Stormwater management - City Land Development Code.

C. *Scope of review.* The following types of applications shall be reviewed to determine whether proposed development impacts a regulated natural or archaeological resource and if so, whether the proposed development complies with the Comprehensive Plan, the Land Development Code and other applicable law with respect to regulated natural and archaeological resources:

1. Future land use map amendments (including large-scale and small-scale);

2. Rezonings and amendments to rezoning ordinances;

3. Development plans;

4. Subdivisions/plats;

5. Special use permits;

6. Commercial tree removal permits; and

7. Other development applications; including but not limited to special exceptions and variances, but excluding building permits.

D. *Exemptions.* The following activities are exempt from review of impacts to regulated natural or archaeological resources. Such activities may, however, require a permit or review under other applicable sections of the Land Development Code.

1. *Certain small parcels of record.* Any parcel of record as of November 13, 1991, that is less than or equal to five acres in size, and does not contain listed species, and does not include in whole or in part an archaeological site identified by a Florida Master Site file number. However, this exemption does not apply in the event the planning parcel equals or is greater than five acres in size.

2. *Bona-fide agriculture/silviculture activities.* Ongoing bona fide agriculture or silviculture operations. However, for bona fide agricultural or silvicultural activities that are part of an application in subsection C. above and located within strategic ecosystems, identification and verification of best management practices shall be required as follows in order to remain exempt from resource review. All references to statutes, publications and rules in this subsection refer to the most current version, as may be amended or renumbered from time to time.

a. The owner or operator shall submit to the city a signed statement identifying and verifying the use of current applicable best management practices. The most recent federal, state, and water management district best management practices (BMPs) shall be required, including, but not limited to, the following:

3) Participation in one of the following cost-share programs: Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), or Forest Land Enhancement Program (FLEP).

3. *Removal of invasive non-native vegetation on conservation lands.* Projects for which a plan has been approved by a federal, state, or local agency or water management district for the removal of undesirable invasive or non-native vegetation on lands owned, controlled, or managed for conservation purposes, excluding vegetation in surface waters and wetlands, which are separately regulated under section 30-8.19 of this Code.

4. *Vegetation on government-maintained land.* Alteration of vegetation pursuant to an adopted management or restoration plan for government-maintained parks, recreation areas, wildlife management areas, conservation areas and preserves.

5. *Activities authorized by city-approved management plan.* Activities consistent with a management plan adopted by, or reviewed and approved by the city, provided that the activities further the natural values and functions of the natural communities present. Examples of such activities include clearing firebreaks for prescribed burns or construction of fences.

6. *Existing utility installations, drainage or stormwater easements, and road right-of-way.* Alteration of vegetation within an existing utility, drainage, or stormwater easement after installation, where the vegetation is interfering with services provided by a utility or alteration of vegetation within an existing road right-of-way for normal maintenance activities. Alteration associated with new construction, expansion of existing facilities, and development activity at an existing site that extends beyond the existing easement area is not an exempt activity.

7. *Fencing and firebreaks.* The minimal removal of trees or understory necessary to construct a fence or wall, or to establish a firebreak, provided that:

a. No regulated tree(s) is removed;

b. The path cleared for the fence does not exceed 10 feet in width on either side of the fence or wall;

c. No equipment heavier than a one-ton pick-up truck is used;

d. Handheld outdoor power equipment or a standard farm tractor is used in clearing for the installation;

e. No dredge or fill activity is required other than the installation of fence and wall materials;

f. Access to navigable waterways will not be impaired by the construction; and

g. Firebreaks established and maintained along each side of a fence or wall shall not exceed 10 feet in width, unless specified by an approved land management plan, by the local fire officer, or, if applicable, in Best Management Practices for Silviculture (2003), incorporated in Rule 5I-6.002, F.A.C., both as may be amended or renumbered from time to time.

8. *Survey or other required test.* The necessary removal of vegetation by, or at the direction of, a State of Florida licensed professional surveyor and mapper, professional geologist, or professional engineer to conduct a survey or other required test, provided that no regulated tree is removed and the path cleared does not exceed ten feet in width.

9. *Text amendments.* Text amendments to PD zoning or PUD land use ordinances that are unrelated to development activity, including, but not limited to, changes in or additions of allowable uses, changes in the expiration dates, or changes in elevations or building facades.

10. *De minimis impact.* Any development activity or application for development review that is of such low intensity as to have a de minimis impact on regulated natural and archaeological resources as determined by the city manager or designee based on a professional review of the development site and application. This may include, but is not limited to, applications involving previously developed sites or small expansions at existing developed sites.

11. *County land use and zoning.* The property has county land use and zoning and will be reviewed under the county's regulations.

12. *Certain prior city approvals.* The property has a final master plan approved by the city prior to August 2, 2012; or has a valid PD zoning ordinance approved by the city prior to August 2, 2012 that addresses natural and archeological resources.

13. *Certain sinkholes.* Sinkholes that form on developed sites may be filled, repaired or otherwise stabilized in order to maintain or prevent structural damage to an existing building or facility (such as a stormwater basin or parking lot).

E. *Levels of review.* The level of resource review shall be classified as follows:

1. *Basic review.* Unless exempt, all applications shall undergo basic review. Basic review shall consist of determining, from available data sources and site visits (where necessary), the potential presence of any regulated natural or archaeological resource. If the basic review indicates the presence of any regulated natural or archaeological resource, then a level 1 review is required. Future land use map amendments (except for PUD) and rezonings (except for PD) both require only basic review.

2. *Level 1 review.* When the applicant has knowledge of the presence of any regulated natural or archaeological resource or if the basic review indicates the potential presence of any regulated natural or archaeological resource, then a level 1 review is required and the applicant shall submit a resources assessment of the natural and archaeological resources on the planning parcel. Level 1 review shall consist of a more detailed review of the project data and the potential impacts identified in the basic review and as further identified in a resources assessment. Level 1 review may include, but is not limited to, coordination with appropriate regulatory agencies, site visits/ground-truthing and recommendation of modifications to the development proposal in order to avoid and minimize impacts to any regulated natural or archaeological resource. If during review it is determined that a management plan for impacts to a regulated natural or archaeological resource is required or a mitigation plan is required, then a level 2 review is required.

3. *Level 2 review.* Level 2 review shall consist of extensive review of the potential impacts, including coordination with appropriate regulatory agencies, recommendation of modifications to the development proposal in order to avoid and minimize potential impacts, review of and comment on the mitigation plan to address remaining impacts or review of the management plan.

F. *Review of planning parcel.* The parcels involved in an application undergoing review to determine the presence of regulated natural and/or archaeological resources shall not be disaggregated, processed in piecemeal fashion, reviewed or developed in any manner that results in lesser natural resource protections than would otherwise be required if the planning parcel was considered as part of the application.

1. Applications for parcels that contain, or potentially contain, regulated natural and/or archaeological resources shall include documentation for the planning parcel.

2. The review and resource assessment required by this Code shall be done for the planning parcel. Where regulated natural or archaeological resources are identified in the resources assessment, in order to proceed with development on any portion of the parcel, the applicant shall demonstrate that developing the project on the parcel does not result in lesser protection of the regulated resources than would otherwise be required if the entire planning parcel were considered as part of the development proposal.

G. *Methodology agreement.* Prior to submittal of any application that requires a level 1 or level 2 review, a binding methodology agreement which includes, but is not limited to, the boundary of the planning parcel, boundary of proposed development, boundary of the geographic study area for resource assessment (if less than the full planning parcel), and the level of review, shall be signed by the city and the applicant.

H. *Staff review.* The city manager or designee is authorized to conduct all staff reviews pursuant to this section. The city manager or designee shall review and evaluate applications and resources assessments and make recommendations to the decision-making authority. Upon reviewing an application or resources assessment, the city manager or designee shall issue a written report that describes: The scope of the review conducted; the presence (or absence) of regulated natural or archaeological resources; the potential (or actual) impacts that the development will have on the regulated natural or archaeological resources; whether the proposed development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and complies with the Land Development Code and other applicable law with respect to the regulated natural or archaeological resources; appropriate site designs and strategies that maintain and protect the functions and values of the natural and archaeological resources; and recommendations to address the impacts. This written report may be issued in the form of technical review comments.

I. *Review fees.* The fees for all reviews are set forth in appendix A, schedule of fees, rates and charges. The fee will cover up to three reviews within a two-year period for the same project. By way of example, a single project that is required to undergo basic and level 1 reviews due to three applications filed within a two-year period for a PD rezoning, a special use permit and a development plan will be charged one level 1 review fee, not three level 1 review fees. The fees shall be paid within five business days (excluding weekends and city holidays) of the date of written notice from the city that a level 1 or level 2 review is required. Failure to timely pay the review fees shall result in the application being deemed incomplete and returned to the applicant.

J. *Pre-application resource consultation.* In order to assist applicants in assessing the probability that any of the regulated natural or archaeological resources are located at a site and to assist planning a development layout and design, an optional, pre-application resource consultation is available. Prior to the submittal of any application listed in section 30-8.11.C., an applicant may request this optional consultation. Staff will review submitted materials provided by the applicant and may visit the site with the applicant, if requested. There is no fee for this pre-application consultation. Any determinations based on this review are non-binding and are made solely for informational purposes and shall not be construed as an approval or denial or agreement to approve or deny a development order associated with the parcel.

K. *Optional binding resource determination process.* Prior to the submittal of any application listed in section 30-8.11.C., an applicant may apply for an optional, binding resource determination of regulated natural and archaeological resources. The purpose of a resource determination is to assist the applicant in determining if and where regulated natural and archaeological resources are present on the planning parcel prior to the preparation of detailed development plans and site layouts. This determination does not vest the applicant for any development rights that will be conferred as part of the final development review and approval process, and any determinations made during the resource determination review shall not be construed as an approval or denial or agreement to approve or deny a development order associated with the planning parcel.

1. *Methodology agreement.* Prior to submitting an application for a binding resource determination, the applicant and the city shall execute a methodology agreement as set forth in section 30-8.11 and establish specific calendar dates when the on-site resources assessment will be conducted.

2. *Requirements for a pre-application resource determination.* Upon execution of the methodology agreement, the applicant may submit an application for a binding resource determination on the form provided by the city. The application shall include payment of the required review fee set forth in appendix A of the city code of ordinances, and a resources assessment per the data requirements of section 30-8.12 for a level 1 review. Since the sole purpose of this binding resource determination is to determine if and where natural and archaeological resources are present on the planning parcel, the applicant shall not submit information about proposed protection areas, impacts of proposed development, or proposed measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate impacts on regulated natural and archaeological resources and the city will not review or make binding determinations on any of the foregoing matters.

3. *Staff review.* The city manager or designee will review the application for completeness and request additional information as required if the application is deemed incomplete. After review of the application, which may include a site visit to the planning parcel, the city reviewer shall issue a written analysis of the application. The written analysis shall provide a verbal description and graphic depiction of the presence and location of significant natural communities, listed species or listed species habitat, strategic ecosystem resources, significant archaeological resources, Floridan aquifer high recharge areas, and significant geological features; any comments or conditions associated with the written analysis; and a recommendation to the city plan board.

4. *Board review.* City staff shall submit the written analysis to the city plan board.

a. *Public hearing.* The city plan board shall hold a public hearing on the resource determination.

b. *Notice.* Notice shall be mailed at least ten calendar days prior to the public hearing to all property owners within 400 feet of the planning parcel. For this purpose, the owner of property shall be deemed to be the person whose name and address is listed in the latest ad valorem tax records provided by the county property appraiser.

c. *City plan board action.*

i. In considering whether to approve or deny a binding resource determination, the city plan board shall consider the evidence presented in the public hearing, including the written analysis of the city reviewer.

viii. Habitat size that will support a viable population.

12. *Strategic ecosystems.* The specific location and extent of regulated strategic ecosystem resources shall be determined through ground-truthing using the KBN/Golder Associates report as a guide to determine the location and extent of the significant natural community or communities, or other natural resources, consistent with the pertinent site summary for the indicated areas as described in the KBN/Golder report. Those areas found not to contain regulated strategic ecosystem resources may be developed provided the ecological integrity of the strategic ecosystem as a whole will be sufficiently protected. The resources assessment shall include:

a. General analysis of adjacent properties sufficient to provide resource context;

b. Ownership and use information, including parcel numbers and acreage, for all land under common ownership or control within the strategic ecosystem or contiguous to the proposed development site;

c. All proposed protection and management strategies for the regulated natural and archaeological resources on the planning parcel; and

d. An evaluation of whether the development proposal is sufficiently protective of the ecological integrity of the strategic ecosystem, and a finding shall be made by the city manager or designee as to whether the development proposal should be revised to sufficiently protect the strategic ecosystem resource in accordance with the provisions of this section.

13. *Significant geological resource features.* The specific location and extent of sinkholes and other geological features shall be determined through ground-truthing. Closed depressions are areas where there is a significant probability that there are sand-filled sinkholes that have no surface indication. A professional geologic study may be required with the objective of locating any sinkholes that are not visible from the surface. If geological resource features are located, the study shall map all of these resources and their buffers.

Sec. 30-8.13. Regulation of natural and archaeological resources.

A. *Applicability.* If basic and level 1 review confirms the presence of a regulated natural or archaeological resource, then the planning parcel shall be further regulated as set forth in this section.

B. *Set-asides, density or intensity transfers.* Density or intensity transfers within the planning parcel shall be allowed where set-asides for resource protection are required. In order to be eligible for the density or intensity transfer, the area of the planning parcel that is receiving density or intensity shall be included in the development proposal and the transfer shall be noted on the approved development order. In the instance where a regulated resource extends across a jurisdictional boundary with the county or another municipality, these regulations shall only apply to the area within Gainesville city limits. The unit number/amount of density/intensity available for transfer will be calculated on the basis of that which is allowed by right within the established zoning district in which the parcel is located, but only for the specific area of the required set-aside attributable solely to regulation under these natural and archaeological resource protection regulations. In the event the transfer within the planning parcel cannot be fully used because of other Land Development Code limitations (such as, but not limited to, height or floor area ratio), the applicant may propose alternative compliance as set forth in section 30-8.16.

C. *Maximum set-aside areas.* The maximum set-aside areas shall be determined as follows:

1. On a planning parcel that does not fall fully or partially within the area of strategic ecosystems, as shown on the environmentally significant land and resource map of the future land use map series, no more than 25 percent of the upland portion of the parcel may be required to be set aside for protection of all regulated natural and archaeological resources.

2. On a planning parcel that does fall fully or partially within the mapped strategic ecosystems area but does not contain evaluated and delineated strategic ecosystem resources, no more than 25 percent of the upland portion of the parcel may be required to be set aside for protection of all regulated natural and archaeological resources.

3. On a planning parcel that does fall fully or partially within the mapped area of strategic ecosystems and contains evaluated and delineated strategic ecosystem resources, no more than 50 percent of the upland portion of the parcel may be required to be set aside for protection of all regulated natural and archaeological resources, including the uplands within the identified strategic ecosystems resource area.

These set-aside maximums may be exceeded when the following environmental resource areas, which shall be protected due to other City Code, state or federal law, are present on a planning parcel: 1) Setbacks/buffers of surface waters and wetlands required by other City Code, state or federal law; or 2) Preservation of archaeological or geological resource areas, and listed species habitat or other critical habitat through regulation by state or federal law.

In every case, these otherwise protected upland areas will be counted first in the determination of the upland set-aside area. In the event that these otherwise protected areas cumulatively do exceed the upland set-aside maximums above, then no additional natural and archaeological set asides will be required.

D. *Significant natural communities.*

1. *On-site protection and set-aside limitations.* Significant natural communities shall be preserved and protected on-site, as follows: The city shall work with the applicant to select that portion of the significant natural community or communities that will be included in the set-aside area, based on the limitations and factors identified in this Code and the FNAI Guide. The applicant may relocate existing vegetation to another portion of the site or establish a new area of native plants on another portion of the site, as part of an approved management plan.

2. *Alternatives to on-site protection.* Alternatives to on-site protection of significant natural communities may be considered in the following circumstances:

a. When physical constraints of the parcel preclude maintenance of ecological integrity of preserved vegetation, given considerations as to size of the development site, habitat quality, connectivity, adjacent uses, and feasibility of management;

b. When opportunities exist for long-term protection and management of significant natural communities of equal or greater habitat value than would have otherwise been protected; or

c. When establishment of conservation management areas within a project would result in small, fragmented areas with limited ecological integrity and value compared to available alternatives.

3. *Standards for alternatives to on-site protection.* If one or more of the circumstances identified above exists, an applicant may propose one or more of the following options, which shall be evaluated to determine whether the alternative provides better protection than on-site protection.

a. The applicant may provide an off-site conservation management area of at least two acres of comparable habitat area for every one acre of on-site significant habitat that would have otherwise required protection by this section; or

b. The applicant may propose an alternative mitigation plan or an alternative compliance plan as provided in this Code, with establishment of a conservation management area and approved management plan, as applicable. Such plans are subject to approval by the city.

E. *Listed species.* If the resources assessment identifies the presence of listed species or potentially occupied listed species habitat, the applicant shall submit a management plan to the city for review and approval that meets federal, state and city regulatory requirements for the species and affords appropriate protection of the listed species and its habitat(s). Where listed species are regulated by the state or federal government, the applicant shall submit to the city the state or federally approved habitat survey and associated management or mitigation plans prior to the issuance of a development order. The city shall consult and coordinate with other permitting agencies, as appropriate. All activities shall comply with applicable state and federal laws, regulations, performance standards, and management guidelines.

1. *On-site habitat protection and set-aside limitations.* Listed species habitat shall be preserved and protected on-site. The city shall work with the applicant to select that portion of the listed species habitat that will be included in the set-aside area, based on the limitations and factors identified in this Code, recommendations of state or federal agencies with jurisdictional authority for the protection of listed species, and the FNAI Guide.

2. *Alternatives to on-site habitat protection.* Alternatives to on-site listed species habitat protection may be considered in the following circumstances:

a. When scientific data demonstrates that on-site protection will not be conducive to the long-term health of the listed species or listed species habitat; or

b. When evidence demonstrates that the protected habitat would be prohibitively difficult to manage adequately due to the management requirements of the habitat; or

c. When protected areas would be less than the smallest minimum territorial requirements of identified species individuals, and cannot be connected with other protected areas which would result in sufficient territorial requirements; or

d. When relocation of a listed species is recommended after consultation with the appropriate state or federal agency, provided that the listed species is relocated prior to any site modifications, in accordance with the city's development order and any authorizations required by a state or federal resource agency.

3. *Standards for alternatives to on-site habitat protection.* If one or more of the circumstances identified above exists, an applicant may propose one of the following options, which shall be evaluated to determine whether the alternative provides better protection than on-site protection:

a. For every one acre of on-site listed species habitat not protected, an off-site protection area shall provide two acres of comparable habitat as a conservation management area. The city may consider alternative mitigation proposals which provide equal or greater protection; or

b. An alternative mitigation plan or an alternative compliance plan as provided in this Code, with establishment of a conservation management area and approved management plan, as applicable.

4. *Special design standards.* Development approval conditions may limit or preclude development of structures, impervious surfaces, and other uses within an appropriate distance of protected species and habitat, if necessary, for the continued viability of the listed species habitat as determined by State of Florida and federal standards if same exists, or by best professional practices based on species. Depending on the type of species, the following special design standards may be required adjacent to regulated listed species habitat to minimize disturbance:

a. A minimum setback of 25 feet from the protected listed species habitat may be required for construction activities. Clearing, grading, and filling may be prohibited within the setback area unless the applicant can demonstrate that vegetation within the protected area will not be damaged.

b. Landscaping within required setbacks may require utilization of native plants that are compatible with existing native plant communities, soils, and climatic conditions.

c. Habitat corridors may be required between protected habitat areas on-site, and between protected areas off-site.

F. *Strategic ecosystems.*

1. *Protection.* Areas of evaluated and delineated strategic ecosystem that will be preserved and protected are subject to the following conditions:

a. Mechanisms to coordinate management activities with adjacent resources in the strategic ecosystem shall be provided, and a management plan shall be required.

b. Vegetation loss, grade change, and disturbance of the development site shall be minimized by careful site design fitted to the topography and soil; removal of vegetation shall be limited to only that necessary to develop the site.

c. Access, infrastructure, stormwater management and utilities shall be sited with consideration to minimizing impacts across multiple properties, providing for wildfire mitigation, and maximizing opportunities for shared facilities such as common driveways, utility access, and building impact areas.

d. The applicant shall consult with the city to select that portion of the strategic ecosystem resources that will be included in the set-aside area, based on the provisions of this Code. No development or other adverse impact to the set-aside portion of the planning parcel shall be allowed, except where necessary to allow access where none is otherwise available. In such case, impact is allowed only in the least sensitive portion of the system and subject to mitigation requirements.

e. Where impact is proposed in the remaining ground-truthed strategic ecosystem resource area outside the required set-aside, the following shall apply:

i. The applicant shall locate development on buildable area outside of the strategic ecosystem to the greatest extent practicable.

ii. Parcels, lots, building areas and driveways shall be configured to minimize overall impact to strategic ecosystem integrity.

iii. Subdivisions and non-residential development shall meet requirements for cluster subdivisions set forth in the Land Development Code, unless otherwise regulated by an adopted planned development ordinance.

2. *Location of set-aside.* The following shall be considered in determining the location of the set-aside requirement for the strategic ecosystem resource:

a. Features that define the strategic ecosystem;

b. Areas critical for system connectivity, and significant natural community areas;

c. Ability to implement and conduct management strategies;

d. Protection and management of additional resources for all properties within the city's limits under common ownership and control within the strategic ecosystem; and

e. If the planning parcel has a city land use or zoning designation, in whole or in part, of Conservation, the upland areas of the Conservation portion shall count toward meeting the strategic ecosystem set-aside requirements.

3. An agriculture/silviculture land use management plan shall be required before any agricultural or silvicultural activity occurs on land containing strategic ecosystem resources that is not used for bona-fide agriculture or silviculture, in accordance with one of the following:

a. The agriculture/silviculture management plan shall provide for retention of the ecological integrity and value of the strategic ecosystem, and may include protection of resource areas through methods including but not limited to conservation easements or participation in a conservation program sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service or the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Affairs.

b. The agriculture/silviculture management plan shall be submitted to the city for review and approval by staff. Management plans not meeting the general standards of this section will require review and approval through the development review process. The agriculture/silviculture management plan may be satisfied by any agricultural or silvicultural certification program's required management plan, provided it demonstrates that the ecological integrity and value of the strategic ecosystem resource is protected.

G. *Floridan aquifer high recharge areas.* The following requirements apply to development on parcels within Floridan Aquifer high recharge areas to ensure both short and long-term protection of the aquifer and groundwater resources:

1. *Existing facilities that handle or store hazardous materials.* Existing facilities shall meet the requirements of Alachua County's Hazardous Materials Management Code. Corrective action to retrofit or upgrade facilities that handle or store hazardous materials consistent with standards applicable to new facilities shall be required when existing facilities are proposed to be modified as part of a development plan. Development review and permitting activities for modification/expansion of existing facilities shall include careful evaluation and implementation of engineering and management controls, setbacks and buffers, and monitoring.

2. *New facilities that handle or store hazardous materials.* New development that involves handling or storing of hazardous materials shall be prohibited in Floridan Aquifer high recharge areas unless it can be demonstrated that the materials, in the quantity and/or solution stored or the conditions under which it is to be stored, do not pose a hazard to human health or the environment. If permitted, such activities shall be subject to the general requirements, siting prohibitions, storage facility standards, and secondary containment and monitoring requirements contained in Alachua County's Hazardous Materials Management Code.

H. *Significant archaeological resources.*

1. Development on parcels identified as containing known or probable archaeological resources shall be conditioned, based on recommendation from an archaeological resource-trained professional, to protect the resource, including but not limited to, insuring proper archaeological investigation prior to development and construction. Avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of adverse impacts on significant archaeological resources shall be required as appropriate to the scale and significance of the resource.

2. The discovery of unmarked human remains or burials during development activity, or other activity, is governed by F.S. §§ 872.02 and 872.05, as same may be amended or renumbered from time to time.

I. *Significant geological resource features.* The purpose of management strategies for significant geological resource features is to protect water quality, hydrologic integrity, and ecological values associated with the feature and its hydrologic regime. Management strategies may include, but are not limited to, filling and development restrictions, buffers, runoff diversion, muck and debris removal, berm and weir construction, and filtration.

1. *Sinkholes.* Open sinkholes and sinkholes with stream inflow shall be identified and protected as conservation management areas. The sinkhole shall be fully protected or restored as a natural area, and the applicant shall submit a plan that demonstrates the elimination of access and the restoration of the land to a natural condition, including stabilization of erosion channels, limiting drainage from non-natural areas, and restoration of buffer areas that have been disturbed. Where the applicant seeks to continue access or make improvements to existing access to a sinkhole, an applicant shall demonstrate the following in the management plan, or if access to the sinkhole is proposed after a management plan has been approved, a revised management plan shall be submitted for review, demonstrating the following:

a. That there is a recreational or scientific benefit that the public derives from the retention or creation of access. If access exists, show that use of the area is such that closing the access would not be practical based on the current level of use.

b. That all sources of erosion or pollution within the sinkhole buffer and the sinkhole are mitigated to eliminate or reduce erosion and pollution to the lowest reasonable level.

c. That the access is the minimum needed to meet the needs. The route chosen shall be the least damaging and least vulnerable to erosion.

d. That a plan for the maintenance of the access, stormwater controls, waste collection, and landscaping has been submitted, approved by the city, and funded.

2. *Protection strategies.* It is recognized that strategies for protection of significant geological resource features vary based on the unique characteristics of the resource and require specific tailoring to address diverse geometries, connections to surface water and ground water, habitat functions and values, and the dynamics of natural systems processes. Such strategies required by the city may include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Significant geological resource features shall be designated and protected as conservation management areas. Significant geological resource features that are capable of being managed on-site shall be identified on development proposals and protected during construction and after development.

b. Features may be incorporated as aesthetic elements into the development project design.

c. Natural topographic features may be retained through lot layout and infrastructure siting.

d. Stormwater management facilities shall be located outside the immediate drainage area associated with sinkholes and other similar karst geological formations, where practicable; and be designed to avoid and minimize impacts of stormwater discharge to the resource area and its characteristic features. The drainage area is the local geographic area which contributes surface water runoff to the resource area, and the management objective is to limit impervious surfaces and design drainage systems so as to ensure that sediments or contaminated water do not reach the sinkhole, solution cavities, or other similar direct conduits to groundwater.

e. Buffers shall be required around significant geologic resources in order to maintain natural context, edge vegetation, and structural protection. The buffer areas around sinkholes or other karst surficial features are intended to protect the resource and groundwater by providing areas where surface or subsurface flows are preserved or restored to a natural condition. In the absence of scientific information which demonstrates that another buffer width is appropriate, the following default buffer widths shall be applied:

i. Sinkholes: An average of 50 feet, but no less than 35 feet away from the outermost closed contour.

ii. Caves, lineaments, ridges, and escarpments: an average of 75 feet, but no less than 50 feet, away from the outermost contour associated with the feature.

iii. Springs, and significant geological resource features located within springsheds: an average of 150 feet, but no less than 100 feet, away from the outermost contour associated with the feature.

f. Where slopes greater than or equal to five percent are found adjacent to sinkholes and inflowing watercourses, existing vegetation shall be substantially retained to minimize erosion consistent with best management practices and surface water and wetland buffers. Development shall be designed to include retention of the natural character of watercourses, seepage slopes and buffers associated with significant geological features.

g. In instances where geological resource features function as habitats for listed species, special protection will be provided in consideration of the habitat characteristics and requirements of the species.

h. Use of best management practices may be required to minimize erosion and maintain water quality, as provided in the Alachua County Water Quality Code

i. Alternatives to on-site protection may be considered when physical constraints of the parcel preclude maintenance of the integrity of the resource, based on considerations such as size of the development site, resource quality, connectivity to the Floridan Aquifer, adjacent uses, or feasibility of management.

Sec. 30-8.14. Conservation management areas and management plans.

A. *Identification of conservation management areas.* The extent of land to be protected within a conservation management area shall include the regulated natural or archaeological resource area(s) which have been evaluated and delineated through the resources assessment, consisting of required set-asides, buffers, setbacks and linkages that preserve the natural system functions of the resource(s).

7. Acts or uses detrimental to such retention of land or water areas;

8. Acts or uses detrimental to the preservation of the structural integrity or physical appearance of sites or properties of historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural significance; and

9. Wastewater and stormwater discharges to conservation management areas are generally prohibited. However, discharges may be allowed only in surface waters, wetlands, and significant geologic features if the following criteria are satisfied:

a. The quantity, timing, and quality of discharge maintains or improves water quality, biological health, and function of the natural ecosystem;

b. Downstream waters are not affected by nutrient loading;

c. The project owner or responsible entity prepares and implements a maintenance and monitoring plan acceptable to the city;

d. The project owner or responsible entity corrects any failures in design or operation of the wastewater and/or stormwater system that cause degradation of water quality, biological health, or the function of the natural ecosystem;

e. The owner or responsible entity posts a performance bond or similar financial guarantee to assure implementation of maintenance and monitoring in compliance with the Land Development Code; and

f. Treatment is provided in accordance with the requirements of the Land Development Code and the requirements of the appropriate water management district.

Protective barriers shall be installed and approved prior to commencement of permitted activities and maintained in place until activities are complete;

2. Erosion and turbidity control measures shall be required in order to prevent runoff of turbid water into conservation management areas; and

3. The owner or responsible entity shall completely restore any portion of a protected conservation management area damaged during the activity. Certificates of occupancy or completion shall not be issued until restoration activity has been completed.

F. *Permanent protection of conservation management areas.* Conservation management areas shall be permanently protected in perpetuity using a legal instrument that runs with the land, in a form acceptable to the city, and duly recorded in the Public Records of Alachua County, which assures the preservation and maintenance of the conservation management area. The preferred legal instrument shall be a conservation easement in accordance with F.S. § 704.06, which restricts the use of the land in perpetuity to conservation uses, or other uses consistent with conservation, and is expressly enforceable by the city. Other forms of dedication may be considered by the city if comparable protection is demonstrated which assures the preservation and maintenance of the conservation management area in accordance with the approved management plan. A boundary or special purpose survey certified by a professional land surveyor registered in the state and meeting minimum technical standards adopted pursuant to F.S. § 472.027, is required for the establishment and dedication of the conservation management area.

G. *Plat and plan notations.* The boundaries of designated conservation management areas, including any required buffers, shall be clearly delineated on development plans, plats, and deed restrictions, and a legal description of the boundaries shall be included.

H. *Field markers.* Permanent survey markers using iron or concrete monuments to delineate the boundary between conservation management areas and contiguous land shall be set, according to current survey standards. Markers shall be installed prior to issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy or other final approval, and shall be maintained by the owner in perpetuity.

I. *Signage.* The perimeter of conservation management areas shall be permanently identified with city-approved signs that identify the area as protected conservation area. Signage that is required by another governmental agency and also meets the city requirements may be used.

J. *Rezoning or land use change.* Conservation management areas may have a land use or zoning change to a conservation land use category or zoning district through a city-initiated or a landowner-initiated process.

K. *Management requirements for conservation management areas.* Conservation management areas shall be maintained in compliance with the provisions of this Code, the conservation easement, the approved management plan, and the following standards. If a management plan is required, the scope of maintenance shall be specified in the management plan. The owner or responsible entity shall not be held responsible for maintenance which exceeds this scope due to external causes, such as through disasters or other events beyond the control of the responsible entity.

1. Unless the area is dedicated to the public use and accepted by the city, the cost and responsibility of managing the conservation management area shall be borne by the owner or responsible entity.

2. Management shall maintain or enhance the ecological value of the conservation management area and support the protection and maintenance of the identified resource. Management shall include, but not be limited to, the following minimum requirements:

Sec. 30-8.15. Avoidance, minimization, mitigation and monitoring.

Development approval shall only be granted for activities that are located, designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid, minimize, and, where necessary, mitigate adverse impacts on regulated natural and archaeological resources, consistent with these sections. Fulfillment of the set-aside requirement shall constitute full compliance with avoidance, minimization, and mitigation related to the upland resources area of the set-aside, except as provided for strategic ecosystems in section 30-8.13.

A. *Avoidance.* Avoidance of loss of the environmental and social benefits and functions of natural and archaeological resources is of the highest priority. The owner shall avoid loss of natural and archaeological resources by implementing practicable design alternatives to minimize adverse impacts to natural and archaeological resources. Specific measures for avoidance which will be required prior to authorization of any adverse impact may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. Limiting the scope, degree or magnitude of the proposed activity;

2. Using appropriate and best available technology;

3. Sensitive site design, siting of facilities, and construction staging activities;

4. Exploring alternative on-site locations to avoid or reduce impacts of activities;

5. Scheduling proposed activities at times of minimum biological activity to avoid periods of migration, rearing, resting, nesting and other species-specific cycles and activities;

6. Managing the access to conservation management areas, such as fencing designed to separate wildlife and pets or to exclude humans from sensitive denning or breeding area; and

7. Preserving and providing perimeter buffering around archaeological sites in order to maintain the security and integrity of the resources. This may include, if necessary, alteration to the proposed development plan.

B. *Minimization.* Where an applicant proves it cannot avoid impacts to regulated natural and archaeological resources due to an extraordinary hardship owing to conditions peculiar to the land or structure and not the result of the actions of the applicant, the following measures may be required to minimize impacts to regulated natural and archaeological resources:

1. Minimum setbacks for clearing of native plants adjacent to regulated natural resources, or for construction of impervious surfaces greater than 100 square feet in base coverage;

2. Limiting native plant removal to the minimum necessary to carry out the proposed activity or to meet fire hazard standards. Protection of tree crowns and root zones may be required for all trees planned for preservation;

3. Roads and other development features located to follow existing topography and minimize cut and fill;

4. Designing stormwater to maximize overland flow through natural drainage systems and grassed overland (roadside and lot line) swales; multi-purpose use of stormwater management systems; use across or for multiple properties;

5. Using performance-based treatment systems, or siting septic tanks and drainfields to prevent discharges that adversely impact the environmental quality of regulated natural and archaeological resources;

6. Adaptive use of archaeological landforms or properties consistent with preservation of their archaeological character; and

7. Other reasonable protective measures necessary to minimize adverse effects may be required depending on conditions specific to a particular site.

C. *Mitigation.* Where an applicant proves that development activities cause or will cause impacts to regulated natural and archaeological resources and cannot be avoided or minimized, and after consideration of any extraordinary hardship owing to conditions peculiar to the land or structure and not the result of the actions of the applicant, mitigation shall be required. The mitigation shall provide compensation for the loss of all functions and values of the impacted resources through restoration, enhancement, and protection of resource areas of equal ecological value. In the case of archaeological resources, mitigation may include, but is not limited to, allowing an opportunity for the acquisition of fee or less-than-fee interest in the archaeological resource by a governmental unit, an organization, or by any other entity committed to the preservation, restoration, or rehabilitation of the resource(s).

1. The requirement for the protection of a mitigation area of comparable resource type shall be based on the following criteria:

a. A replacement ratio of one to one for physical access when no other physical access is available and impact is in the least sensitive portion of the resource for the limited purpose of providing access to the parcel.

b. Except as provided in subsection C.1.a., a replacement ratio of two to one for impacts to regulated strategic ecosystem resources.

c. Except as provided in subsections C.1.a. and C.1.b., a replacement ratio of two to one for impacts to regulated natural and archaeological resources; except the replacement ratio is reduced to one to one for parcels less than or equal to five acres which do not include regulated strategic ecosystem resources and when an extraordinary hardship is caused by the small parcel size and/or configuration and owing to conditions that are not the result of actions by the applicant, as determined by the appropriate reviewing entity.

2. Resource-based mitigation shall be provided on-site or off-site. The order of preference in which mitigation will be considered shall be:

a. *On-site restoration or enhancement.* An applicant may mitigate for impacts on-site by conducting resource restoration or enhancement on the planning parcel, species relocation within the planning parcel, if applicable, or other measures to restore the quality, function and value of the resource. The establishment of a conservation management area and/or conservation easement, acceptable to the city may be required to ensure the continued viability of the area to be restored or enhanced.

b. *Off-site preservation.* The applicant may provide off-site mitigation through the preservation of land through off-site dedication, transfer of fee or less-than-fee simple title to a land conservation agency, non-profit conservation organization, or other entity approved by the city. Areas designated as conservation management areas for mitigation under this chapter shall not be used as credit towards mitigation for other projects or to mitigate for impacts to other regulated environmental resources such as trees or surface waters/wetlands. Mitigation areas are eligible only if the area would not otherwise be required to be set aside. Mitigation of impacts to a regulated listed species or its habitat that is required by a state or federal agency shall be applied towards off-site mitigation if it is for the same development project and meets the following requirements:

i. Off-site protection sites shall meet all appropriate size, site selection and design, protection, ownership and maintenance, and other provisions of this Code applicable to on-site conservation management areas. Fencing may be required to control access to the mitigation area.

ii. Off-site conservation management areas shall be located in the following order of priority: 1) Adjacent to the planning parcel; 2) Within the City of Gainesville municipal limits; 3) Within the City of Gainesville urban reserve area; and 4) Within other municipalities or the unincorporated area of Alachua County outside of the City of Gainesville urban reserve area.

3. A mitigation proposal shall be submitted with the resources assessment. The mitigation proposal shall require the same assessment and specify the same details for mitigation areas as required for resources assessments in section 30-8.12. The cost and timing of any off-site acquisitions shall be specified. The mitigation proposal shall meet the following general mitigation standards, and shall be evaluated based on an assessment of the natural functions and values of both the proposed impact areas and the proposed mitigation areas. The mitigation proposal shall be acceptable only where it is determined that the mitigation will fully offset the loss of the functions and values of the regulated resource. The mitigation proposal shall demonstrate:

a. The hydrologic, soil, slope, and other basic characteristics of the proposed mitigation project shall be adequate to achieve proposed mitigation project goals; and

b. The mitigation area shall be at least as well established and sustainable as the existing regulated natural or archaeological resource it is intended to replace.

4. A management plan shall be required and shall include contingency plans for corrective measures or change if goals are not met. The management plan shall generally provide for, but not be limited to, the following:

a. Where plantings are required, success shall be measured by maintenance of at least 80 percent survivorship of all plantings. Semiannual replanting shall be required to maintain required survivorship.

b. Removal and/or control of non-native invasive vegetation.

c. The owner/applicant is responsible for submitting monitoring reports of the status of the mitigation area to the city manager or designee no less than annually. In the event the owner/applicant transfers fee simple ownership of the mitigation area to a third-party agency or entity whose purposes include protecting and preserving natural or archeological resources, the city manager or designee may waive the annual monitoring report requirement upon a finding that the agency or entity has substantial expertise in management of such resources. Indicators appropriate to the resource shall be tracked and evaluated. Such indicators may include water quality chemistry, number of surviving plantings and any plantings made to maintain required survivorship. The final report for release of the performance guarantee shall include, at a minimum:

i. Discussion of the projected relative success or failure of the project in mitigating for lost natural resource area value and function;

ii. Analysis of measures undertaken during the project that contributed to success;

iii. Analysis of problems encountered during the project that decreased success;

iv. Recommendations to increase the success of similar, future projects; and

v. Summary of data collected.

5. *Management and monitoring.* For all mitigation projects, the owner/applicant shall be responsible for management and monitoring for a minimum of three years, unless waived by the city manager or designee, as provided in subsection 4. above. This period may be extended as necessary, based on the complexity of the resource or type of mitigation proposed, in order to demonstrate substantial establishment and success of mitigation. Management and monitoring shall comply with the provisions of this Code and with the approved mitigation management plan.

6. *Performance guarantee.* A performance guarantee shall be required in an amount equal to 110 percent of the estimated cost of mitigation, management and monitoring activities, to ensure the adequate monitoring and long-term viability of mitigation activities. The guarantee shall be provided for the duration of the time period required for maintenance and monitoring and until completion is certified by the city. The performance guarantee shall be kept in full force until all obligations are satisfied. The guarantee shall be in one of the financial assurance forms stated in section 30-8.21 and shall be submitted to the city. Within six months after the end of the period established for management and monitoring, the applicant shall submit a final report that details and certifies compliance with the requirements of this Code.

Sec. 30-8.16. Alternative compliance.

An applicant may submit a proposal for alternative compliance which varies from the strict application of these natural and archaeological resource regulations to accommodate an extraordinary hardship or to utilize innovative design. Requests for alternative compliance from any natural or archaeological resource provision shall be reviewed and decided by the board or staff responsible for reviewing and taking action on the development application. An alternative compliance plan shall be approved only upon a finding that it fulfills the intent and purposes of the City of Gainesville's Comprehensive Plan and of these regulations as well as, or more effectively than, adherence to the strict requirements of these regulations. When granted, the alternative compliance shall be the minimum deviation from the requirements necessary to permit reasonable use or access. Mitigation may be required as a condition of granting the alternative compliance.

A. *Extraordinary hardship.* The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating the existence of an extraordinary hardship due to unique site characteristics and the reasons for alternative compliance. The application shall set forth facts demonstrating each of the following:

1. That the applicant did not create their own hardship by taking actions that makes the property unable to be developed. Diminished value or inconvenience, or lack of due diligence, is not considered extraordinary hardship.

2. There are no feasible on-site alternatives to the proposal. Feasible on-site alternatives include, but are not limited to:

a. Reduction in density or intensity;

b. Reduction in scope or size;

c. Change in timing, phasing, or implementation; or

d. Layout revision or other innovative site design considerations.

B. *Innovative design.* The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that an innovative site design may be utilized that better protects regulated natural and archaeological resources. The application shall set forth facts demonstrating that the proposed innovative design will protect regulated natural and archaeological resources and will not jeopardize the ecological integrity of those resources on or adjacent to the property.

#### DIVISION 4. SURFACE WATERS AND WETLANDS

Sec. 30-8.17. Regulated surface waters and wetlands.

All regulated surface waters and wetlands that are located in whole or in part within city limits are regulated by this article. Regulated surface waters and wetlands are as follows:

A. Surface waters delineated pursuant to Rule 62-340.600, F.A.C., as may be amended or renumbered from time to time.

B. Wetlands delineated pursuant to Rule 62-340.300, F.A.C., as may be amended or renumbered from time to time.

Sec. 30-8.18. Exemptions.

A. The provisions of the surface waters and wetlands sections of this article shall not apply to:

1. Unless otherwise provided herein, any construction, development or use initiated pursuant to any valid building permit or approved development plan issued or approved before April 12, 2004.

2. Any public works or utilities projects initiated by the city or by a property owner acting with the authorization of the city and state agencies (the state department of environmental protection or the appropriate water management district) to provide utility services or to maintain or modify existing public works or utilities infrastructure or to provide controlled stormwater discharge to the creek, lake or wetland. However, such projects shall not be exempt from first avoiding loss or degradation of wetland functions and habitats, and then minimizing unavoidable loss or degradation of wetland function and habitats. Such projects that cause unavoidable loss or degradation of wetland functions or habitats shall be clearly in the public interest.

3. Repairs or replacement to the site structure(s) that do not increase the external dimensions of site impervious surface. When such development does increase said dimensions, the development up to the point at which dimensions increase will be exempt.

4. Additions or accessory structures that do not add more than 100 square feet of impervious surface area cumulative from April 12, 2004, including any construction that does not require a building permit, and are at a distance greater than 50 feet from the landward extent of the wetland, or greater than 75 feet from the landward extent of the lake, or greater 35 feet from the break in slope at the top of the bank of a regulated creek. However, the placement of limerock surface, irrespective of size, shall comply with the provisions of these sections.

5. Any construction or development initiated pursuant to the development plan of a planned development approved prior to April 12, 2004, if the development plan depicts the location of the buildings and structures on the site or if special consideration has been given to the issue of creek, lake or wetland protection as evidenced by specific limitations and/or restrictions having been placed on the lots or buildings during the approval process.

6. Construction of public or private nature trails if the proposed plan is consistent with the intent of these sections and complies with each of the following restrictions:

a. There is no significant alteration of creek, lake or wetland drainage patterns or special protection species population reduction or habitat alteration due to the trail.

b. The natural grade within the buffer area is maintained to the maximum feasible extent.

c. The maximum width for private trails within 35 feet of the break in slope at the top of the bank of a regulated creek or within 50 feet of a wetland is 50 inches. The maximum width for private trails within 75 feet of a regulated lake is 50 inches. A private trail greater than 50 inches in width that is located between 35 feet and 150 feet from the break in slope at the top of the bank of a regulated creek, is presumed detrimental to the creek unless the trail plan demonstrates otherwise. The width of public trails shall be set during site plan review.

d. Materials used for the trails construction are limited to asphaltic concrete, concrete, wood, compacted earth, mulch, crushed shells or other materials that will not result in the creek receiving significant amounts of sediment or other adverse material harmful to the creek water quality. If materials other than asphaltic concrete or concrete are used, such materials shall be stabilized to prevent washouts or soil erosion.

e. Developers, their successors and assigns of private trails shall provide the city with a maintenance agreement which is acceptable to the city attorney and provide for maintenance and preservation of the trail to ensure there is no adverse impact to creek, lake or wetland vegetation, water quality, or creek or lake bank soils.

7. The reestablishment of native vegetation. When the reestablishment of native vegetation is for any property other than a single-family residential dwelling, a vegetative reestablishment plan shall be subject to the approval of the city manager or designee to ensure the appropriateness of the vegetation proposed and to ensure the incorporation of proper sediment control measures.

8. All human-built impoundments, lakes, streams, ponds, and artificial or created wetlands, provided that development activities in these areas will not adversely impact natural or mitigation surface waters and wetlands. If these facilities were required as a mitigation project, they shall not be exempt from the provisions of these sections. If any surface waters or wetlands are part of a stormwater management facility approved by the city, the same functions shall be provided and any modifications shall be subject to approval by the public works department.

9. Stormwater management facilities are allowed within wetland buffers provided that: The stormwater management facility will not adversely impact natural or mitigation surface waters and wetlands; the hydroperiod of the wetland will be maintained or restored; the stormwater management facility will have a maximum slope of 4:1; littoral zones will be established and maintained in all wet detention facilities; and that landscaping of stormwater management facilities will conform to section 30-8.3 and all other applicable requirements of chapter 30, and to the Design Manual. Stormwater management facilities are not exempt from the buffer requirements of section 30-8.20 for regulated creeks or lakes.

B. All development, even if exempt or otherwise granted an exemption from any other provisions of these sections, shall incorporate either the city's general criteria for controlling erosion and sediment or equivalent practices.

Sec. 30-8.19. Surface waters and wetlands review.

A. *Scope of review.* The following types of applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed development impacts regulated surface waters or wetlands, and if so, whether the proposed development complies with the Comprehensive Plan, the Land Development Code and other applicable law with respect to surface waters and wetlands:

1. Future land use map amendments (including large-scale and small-scale);

2. Rezonings and amendments to rezoning ordinances;

3. Development plans (including minor plan, minor plan II, intermediate plan and major plan);

4. Subdivisions/plats;

5. Special use permits;

6. Commercial tree removal permits; and

7. Other development applications, including without limitation special exceptions and variances.

B. *Reviewing authority.* The city manager or designee is authorized to conduct all reviews pursuant to this section.

C. *Level of review.* The level of review shall be classified as follows:

1. *Basic review.* All applications shall undergo basic review. Basic review shall consist of determining, from available data sources and site visits (where necessary), the potential presence of any regulated surface waters and wetlands. If the basic review indicates the presence of any regulated surface waters or wetlands, then a level 1 review is required.

2. *Level 1 review.* Level 1 review shall consist of more detailed review of the project data and the potential impacts identified in the basic review, including coordination with appropriate regulatory agencies, site visits and recommendation of modifications to the development proposal in order to avoid or minimize impacts to the regulated surface waters or wetlands. If during environmental review it is determined that a mitigation plan for impacts to the regulated surface waters and wetlands is required, then a level 2 review is required.

3. *Level 2 review.* Level 2 review shall consist of extensive review of the potential environmental impacts, including coordination with appropriate regulatory agencies, recommendation of modifications to the development proposal in order to avoid and minimize potential impacts; and review of and comment on the mitigation plan to address remaining impacts.

D. *Review report.* Upon reviewing an application, the reviewing authority shall issue a written report that describes: The scope of the review conducted; the presence (or absence) of regulated surface waters and wetlands; whether the proposed development complies with the Comprehensive Plan, the Land Development Code and other applicable law with respect to the regulated surface waters and wetlands; the potential (or actual) impacts that the development will have on the environmental features of concern and the reviewing authority's recommendations to address the impacts.

E. *Review fees.* The fees for all reviews are set forth in appendix A, schedule of fees, rates and charges. The fee will cover up to three reviews within a two-year period for the same project. By way of example, a single project that is required to undergo basic and level 1 reviews due to three applications filed within a two-year period for a PD rezoning, a special use permit and a development plan will be charged one level 1 review fee, not three level 1 review fees. The fees shall be paid within five business (excludes weekends and city holidays) days of the date of written notice from the city that a level 1 or level 2 review is required. Failure to timely pay the review fees shall result in the application being deemed incomplete and returned to the applicant.

Sec. 30-8.20. General requirements and procedures.

A. Wetlands and required wetland buffers shall not be included within any platted lots or blocks of any subdivision (not including lot splits and minor subdivisions) that is approved after April 12, 2004.

B. Except as otherwise provided, there shall be no development in, on or over a surface water or wetland, or within 75 feet of the landward extent of a regulated lake, or within 35 feet of the break in slope at the top of the bank of any regulated creek.

C. A minimum buffer distance of 35 feet and an average minimum buffer distance of 50 feet shall be required between the developed area and the landward extent of any wetland or surface water, other than (as provided in the preceding paragraph) a regulated lake or creek. Figure 1 depicts the minimum 50-foot buffer distance without encroachment. Wherever the buffer distance is less than 50 feet, the amount of such encroachment along the 50-foot buffer line shall be mitigated along an equal length of buffer line contiguous to the encroachment. Such mitigation shall consist of increasing the minimum buffer distance so that the average minimum buffer distance of 50 feet is maintained at that location. Figures 2 and 3 depict encroachment of the 50-foot distance with required mitigation contiguous to the encroachment. The required increase in minimum buffer distance can be provided along an equal length of buffer line not contiguous to the encroachment only if greater protection of wetland resources can be attained, subject to the approval of the city manager or designee or appropriate reviewing board. See Figure 4 for depiction of increased minimum buffer distance along equal length of buffer line not contiguous to the encroachment.

D. The average minimum distance of 50 feet shall be maintained under all circumstances unless it is established, prior to permitting, by competent, substantial evidence that a distance greater than 50 feet is required for the protection of wetland functions, as required by this article. Buffers shall remain in an undisturbed condition except for drainage features that will not adversely affect wetland functions and public infrastructure exempted by section 30-8.18. Outfall structures from stormwater retention or detention basins can be allowed within required buffers. The buffer shall not apply to surface waters or wetlands created by humans, except those wetlands that are created for mitigation. The buffer shall be clearly delineated with permanent markers.

E. Within required wetland or surface water buffers, there shall be no placement of impervious surfaces or sod, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this article. All invasive, non-native plant species listed in section 30-8.3 shall be removed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. All plants listed on the Noxious Weed List, Section 5B-57.007, Florida Administrative Code, shall be removed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Native vegetation shall be retained and/or installed in order to protect wetland and surface water environmental features.

F. Outstanding Florida Waters, as listed in Section 62-302.700, Florida Administrative Code, shall have a minimum buffer of 200 feet.

G. For development activity between 35 and 150 feet from the break in slope at the top of the bank of any regulated creek, it is a rebuttable presumption that the development activity is detrimental to the regulated creek and is therefore prohibited unless approval is granted as set forth below.

H. Development plans for lots within 150 feet of any regulated creek shall demonstrate compliance with the following standards (standards (2) and (3) shall not be applied to residential single-family lots):

1. The development will not introduce erosion and sediment pollution to the creek both during and after construction;

2. The first one inch of runoff or appropriate water management district standards, whichever is greater, will either be retained or detained through filtration on the project site;

3. There will be no net increase in the rate of runoff from the site;

4. There is no threat to the stability of the creek bank; and

5. There will be no placement of buildings, structures, impervious surfaces, or sod that would require the removal of vegetation integral to the creek's ecological value. All invasive, non-native plant species listed in section 30-8.3 shall be removed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. All plants listed on the Noxious Weed List, Section 5B-57.007, Florida Administrative Code shall be removed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Native vegetation shall be installed and/or retained to protect surface water or wetland environmental features.

I. The development will not modify groundwater levels so as to have an adverse impact on the hydrological regime of a surface water or wetland. For the purposes of this provision, adverse impact is defined as a change that prevents the surface water or wetland from maintaining a structure and function equivalent to pre-development levels.

J. If a proposed development requires development plan review pursuant to article III, the showing of compliance with the requirements of the surface waters and wetlands sections of article VIII shall be made in development plan review. The petition for development plan review shall provide both a hydrological report and construction plans prepared by a qualified engineer registered in the state.

K. If a proposed development does not require development plan review, a showing of compliance shall be certified by the city manager's designee prior to issuance of any building permit. To demonstrate compliance with the requirements concerning quality and control of erosion and sediment pollution, the development plan may employ the city's "General Criteria for Controlling Erosion and Sediment," in the design manual, or equivalent practices, rather than employing the more elaborate hydrological and soil reports used in development plan review. Compliance with the measures required by "General Criteria for Controlling Erosion and Sediment" shall be presumed sufficient to meet the standards in subsections 30-8.20.H.1., 2. and 3. The development plan shall provide enough information to demonstrate compliance with the remaining standards, but need not ordinarily be prepared by a registered engineer. A professional land surveyor certified by the state shall provide the lot boundaries survey and topographical information.

L. On-site transfer of development intensity and density. In order to protect surface water features of a site, development intensity and density for building areas may be transferred from a lower to a higher elevation within the same property or adjacent property under the same ownership and zoning category. Intensity and density may be apportioned over the property by reserving the surface water and its buffer area as common open space. If all of the intensity and density is transferred to the adjacent property, the owner shall record a restriction in the chain of title of the transferor property, prior to issuance of a final development order, to restrict the use of the land in perpetuity to non-development uses, with such restrictions being expressly enforceable by the city.

Sec. 30-8.21. Avoiding loss or degradation of wetlands.

Wetlands within and around the City of Gainesville provide environmental benefits such as water quality improvement, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge and wildlife habitat, especially for species listed as endangered, threatened or of special concern by state and federal agencies, plus recreational, aesthetic and educational opportunities for people. These functions may be provided regardless of wetland size. Wetlands damaged or degraded shall either be restored to their function and condition prior to such damage, or mitigated pursuant to the mitigation requirements in the Comprehensive Plan, this Code, and in accordance with appropriate water management district standards.

A. *Purpose and intent.* The purpose of this section is to avoid loss or degradation of wetland functions, to minimize unavoidable degradation or loss of wetland functions and to require mitigation that fully offsets any unavoidable loss or degradation of wetland functions. In addition, it is the purpose of this section to ensure that development activities that cause the unavoidable degradation or loss of wetland function are clearly in the public interest and fully offset any degradation or loss of wetland functions through sustainable mitigation. This section should contribute to the restoration of wetlands functions in the city.

B. *Applicability.* Except as provided below this section shall be applicable to all wetlands within the City of Gainesville. This section shall not apply to the maintenance of permitted stormwater systems.

C. *Delineation.* Wetlands shall be delineated pursuant to Rule 62-340.300, Florida Administrative Code. Delineations performed by the State of Florida pursuant to Rule 62-340.300, Florida Administrative Code, shall be binding on the city for the purposes of this section.

D. *Avoidance through minimization.* Avoidance of loss of wetland function and wetland habitat is of the highest priority. The owner shall avoid loss of wetland function and wetland habitat by implementing practicable design alternatives to minimize adverse impacts to wetlands, except as permitted in this section.

The adverse impacts remaining after practicable design modifications have been made shall be offset by mitigation as provided herein. A development activity cannot cause a net adverse impact on wetland functions, wetland habitat, or surface water functions, if such activity is not offset by mitigation.

Avoidance through practicable design modifications is not required when the ecological value of the function provided by the area of wetland is low and the proposed mitigation will provide greater long-term ecological value than the area of wetland to be affected.

E. *Conditions for the issuance of a development permit for property upon which wetlands are located.* The city manager or designee or appropriate reviewing board shall review all permit applications based on the conditions set forth below. No development of property containing wetlands shall be permitted unless the owner provides reasonable assurance that the activity:

1. Will not adversely impact the value of wetland functions provided to fish and wildlife and listed species;

2. Will not cause adverse secondary or cumulative impacts to water and wetland resources;

3. Will be capable, based on generally accepted engineering and scientific principles, of being performed and of functioning as proposed;

4. Will be conducted by an entity with the sufficient financial, legal and administrative capability to ensure that the activity will be undertaken in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit, if issued;

5. Will comply with criteria for buffer zones set forth herein;

6. Is consistent with the owner's stormwater management permit, if required; and

7. Is clearly in the public interest based on a balancing of the following criteria:

a. Whether the development activity requires location in, on, or over wetlands or surface waters in order to fulfill its basic function;

b. The effect of the development activity on the public health, safety, or welfare or the property of others;

c. The effect of the development activity on fish, wildlife and native plant communities;

d. The effect of the development activity on recreation, open space and aesthetic values;

e. The effect of the development activity on significant historical and archaeological resources;

f. Whether the development activity will be of a temporary or permanent nature;

g. The current condition and relative value of wetland functions being performed by areas affected by the proposed activity;

h. The type, extent, and geographic location of any mitigation proposed;

i. The extent to which the development furthers the goals of the Comprehensive Plan, and the proximity of the development to existing infrastructure.

F. *Mitigation.* This section applies to development activities in wetlands, which cannot be avoided or minimized, as determined by the criteria stated herein. Mitigation means an action or series of actions to offset the adverse impacts that would otherwise cause a regulated activity to fail to meet the criteria set forth herein.

1. *Types of mitigation; mitigation ratios.* Mitigation consists of creation, preservation, enhancement, restoration, or a combination thereof in accordance with the ratios and preferences set forth in Chapter 62-345, Florida Administrative Code (Uniform Mitigation Assessment Method).

a. Preservation means the protection of wetlands, other surface waters or uplands from adverse impacts by placing a conservation easement or other comparable land use restriction over the property, in favor of the governmental entity with the appropriate jurisdiction.

b. Enhancement is an improvement in wetland function.

c. Restoration means converting existing wetlands, surface waters or uplands from a disturbed or altered condition to a previously existing natural condition to the maximum extent possible.

d. Creation means the establishment of new wetlands or surface waters by conversion of other landforms. Wetland creation is the least acceptable mitigation alternative and shall be considered only when preservation, restoration or enhancement within the sub-basin, basin or adjacent basin are infeasible at the ratios provided and when the owner can demonstrate that the proper hydrology and geology exist to make a created wetland sustainable.

2. *Location of mitigation.* Any mitigation required pursuant to this section shall be performed within the basins and sub-basins described below, and may be performed on-site.

Sec. 30-8.22. Single-family lots.

A. *Applicability of standards.* All development of single-family lots shall comply with the surface waters and wetlands sections of this article. If a subdivision plat has satisfied the requirements of these sections, the city may issue a certification of compliance for some or all of the lots in the subdivision at one time. In that case the lots are subject to further compliance review at the time of issuance of a building permit, only for compliance with the construction measures required by general criteria for controlling erosion and sediment.

B. *Special permits.* In order to allow the reasonable development of a single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures and driveways on platted lots regulated by the surface waters and wetlands sections of this article, the development review board may grant a modification from compliance with the minimum buffer requirements of these sections only to the extent necessary to accommodate such reasonable development. As part of the same proceedings, the board may also grant variances to the yard setbacks required by this chapter in order to facilitate compliance with these sections subject to a finding that such special permits will neither be injurious to adjacent property owners or the neighborhood nor detrimental to the public welfare.

1. *Minimum requirement for special permits.* Special permits may be granted by the Development Review Board for single-family lots located within the 75-foot required minimum buffer for regulated lakes, or within the required average minimum buffer distance of 50 feet from the landward extent of any wetland or surface water, or within 150 feet of the break in slope at the top of bank of a regulated creek for lots which are lawfully created before April 12, 2004.

2. *Criteria for granting of special permits.* The following criteria shall be used in deciding whether and to what extent a special permit should be granted:

a. The development review board shall determine what is reasonable development of a single-family lot, accessory structures and drives and shall consider the following factors:

i. The size of existing single-family dwellings in the immediate vicinity should serve as a guide to what is customary and reasonable for the property under review.

ii. No special permit shall be granted for the purpose of accommodating a swimming pool, tennis court, racquetball court or similar recreational structure, or to accommodate accessory uses that are not customary on single-family lots or exceed the customary size.

b. The Development Review Board shall consider features of the site, including its topography, the width of the creek bed, and the presence or absence of vegetation natural to the creek, lake or wetland, which indicate that a special permit would or would not further the goals of these sections.

c. The development review board shall consider building code requirements, including building orientation requirements to meet energy efficiency standards that affect the design and/or orientation of structures on the lot.

d. The development review board shall consider presence of trees eight inches or greater in diameter at a point four and one-half feet above the ground level that can only be preserved if a special permit is granted.

3. The development review board shall consider staff reports as needed in reaching its decision. In granting a special permit the board shall establish measures to ensure that the goals of these sections are substantially met, in particular maintaining natural vegetation where feasible, preventing sedimentation loading to the creek, lake or wetland, maintaining the stability of the creek or lake bank, and preventing the degradation of the water quality of the creek, lake or wetland. To achieve these aims, the Development Review Board shall attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, such as construction control techniques and other mitigative measures, as it deems necessary.

C. *Special permit procedures.* Applications shall be processed in accordance with the requirements in this chapter relating to variances, established for the development review board.

#### DIVISION 5. FLOODPLAINS

Sec. 30-8.23. Administration.

A. *Title.* These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance (FPO) of the City of Gainesville, hereinafter referred to as "FPO Division 5."

C. *Intent.* The purposes of FPO Division 5 and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to:

1. Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding;

2. Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage;

3. Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential;

4. Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain;

5. Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities;

6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas;

7. Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and

8. Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the 44 CFR 59.22.

D. *Coordination with the Florida Building Code.* FPO Division 5 is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code.

E. *Warning.* The degree of flood protection required by FPO Division 5 and the Florida Building Code, as amended by the City of Gainesville, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. FPO Division 5 does not express or imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of 44 CFR 59 and 44 CFR 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring the city to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with FPO Division 5.

F. *Disclaimer of liability.* FPO Division 5 shall not create liability on the part of the City of Gainesville or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that occurs, notwithstanding compliance with FPO Division 5 or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

In order to qualify for this determination, the fill shall have been permitted and placed in accordance with the city's floodplain management regulations.

4. ***Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR):*** A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such projects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A CLOMR does not revise the effective flood insurance rate map or flood insurance study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a letter of map revision may be issued by FEMA to revise the effective FIRM.

***Light-duty truck*** means, as defined in 40 CFR 86.082-2, any motor vehicle rated at 8,500 pounds gross vehicular weight rating or less which has a vehicular curb weight of 6,000 pounds or less and which has a basic vehicle frontal area of 45 square feet or less, which is:

1. Designed primarily for purposes of transportation of property or is a derivation of such a vehicle;

2. Designed primarily for transportation of persons and has a capacity of more than 12 persons; or

3. Available with special features enabling off-street or off-highway operation and use.

***Lowest floor*** means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area of a building or structure, including basement, but excluding any unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, other than a basement, usable solely for vehicle parking, building access or limited storage provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation requirements of the Florida Building Code or ASCE 24.

***Manufactured home*** means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is eight feet or more in width and greater than 400 square feet, and which is built on a permanent, integral chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities.

***Manufactured home park or subdivision*** means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

***Market value*** means the price at which a property will change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither party being under compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. As used in FPO Division 5, the term refers to the market value of buildings and structures, excluding the land and other improvements on the parcel. Market value may be established by a qualified independent appraiser, actual cash value (replacement cost depreciated for age and quality of construction), or tax assessment value adjusted to approximate market value by a factor provided by the property appraiser.

***New construction*** means, for the purposes of administration of FPO Division 5 and the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after October 1, 1971, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

***Start of construction*** means the date of development permit issuance for new construction and substantial improvements to existing structures, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement is within 180 calendar days of the date of the issuance. The actual start of construction means either the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, or the construction of columns. Permanent construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing, grading, or filling), the installation of streets or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, the erection of temporary forms or the installation of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main buildings. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

***Substantial damage*** means damage of any origin sustained by a building or structure whereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the damage occurred.

***Substantial improvement*** means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has incurred "substantial damage," any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

1. Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

2. Any alteration of a historic structure provided the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

***Variance*** means a grant of relief from the requirements of FPO Division 5, or the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, which permits construction in a manner that would not otherwise be permitted by FPO Division 5 or the Florida Building Code.

***Watercourse*** means a river, creek, stream, channel or other topographic feature in, on, through, or over which water flows at least periodically.

C. *Limitations on authority to grant variances.* The appropriate reviewing board shall base its decisions on variances on technical justifications submitted by applicants, the considerations for issuance in subsection 30-8.30.G. of FPO Division 5, the conditions of issuance set forth in subsection 30-8.30.H. of FPO Division 5, and the comments and recommendations of the floodplain administrator and the building official. The appropriate reviewing board has the right to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of FPO Division 5.

D. *Restrictions in floodways.* A variance shall not be issued for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in base flood elevations would result, as evidenced by the applicable analyses and certifications required in subsection 30-8.28.C. of FPO Division 5.

E. *Historic buildings.* A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair, improvement, or rehabilitation of a historic building that is determined eligible for the exception to the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, Existing Building, Chapter 12, Historic Buildings, upon a determination that the proposed repair, improvement, or rehabilitation will not preclude the building's continued designation as a historic building and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the building. If the proposed work precludes the building's continued designation as a historic building, a variance shall not be granted and the building and any repair, improvement, and rehabilitation shall be subject to the requirements of the Florida Building Code.

F. *Functionally dependent uses.* A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the variance meets the requirements of subsection 30-8.30.D., is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, and all due consideration has been given to use of methods and materials that minimize flood damage during occurrence of the base flood.

G. *Considerations for issuance of variances.* In reviewing requests for variances, the appropriate reviewing board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other applicable provisions of the Florida Building Code, FPO Division 5, and the following:

1. The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage;

2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

3. The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners;

4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community;

5. The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are subject to lower risk of flooding or erosion;

6. The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development;

7. The relationship of the proposed development to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program for the area;

8. The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

10. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.

H. *Conditions for issuance of variances.* Variances shall be issued only upon:

1. Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of FPO Division 5 or the required elevation standards;

2. Determination by the appropriate reviewing board that:

a. Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship;

b. The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and

c. The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

3. Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and

4. If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation, and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(Ord. No. 210195, § 1, 10-21-21)

Sec. 30-8.31. Violations.

Sec. 30-8.39. Applicability and effect.

A. *Effect of classification.* The wellfield, nature park and public conservation/preservation areas, and greenway districts are overlay district classifications. They are intended to operate in conjunction with the underlying zoning district for the area. The regulations of the underlying zoning district remain in effect except to the extent that they are modified by the provisions of the applicable overlay district(s).

B. *Administration.* The wellfield, nature park and public conservation/preservation areas, and greenway districts shall be applied and enforced like any other zoning district regulation.

C. *Extension of district boundaries.* Property owners may apply for inclusion in the environmental overlay districts, regardless of contiguity. Such an extension or inclusion shall be subject to review and consideration according to the applicable terms of this article and shall be processed as a rezoning in accordance with this chapter. The city commission may extend or expand districts from time to time in accordance with the same standards and procedures as for the original district as determined by the Comprehensive Plan.

D. *Exclusion from district boundaries.* It is a rebuttable presumption that a property qualifies for inclusion within the wellfield district. Qualified properties are those that are within the zone of contribution to the wellfield, as defined by the applicable water management district. Property owners whose land is within the district may apply for exclusion from the district. Such an exclusion shall be based on a determination made by a qualified engineer registered in the State of Florida that the property is not part of the zone of contribution. This determination is subject to review and consideration by the city public works department and the county office of environmental protection and the public utility according to the applicable terms of this article and shall be processed as a rezoning in accordance with this chapter.

Sec. 30-8.40. Wellfield district.

A. *Adoption of wellfield district.* The wellfield district is delineated on the map entitled, "Map Displaying Community Wellfields of Gainesville, Florida," on file with the city.

Buildings shall not be externally illuminated on the faces fronting the park, except that exterior lighting of building entrances, exits or loading docks is permitted. Downlights shall be used for area lighting instead of full globe lights or any similar type of light which illuminates in all directions.

4. *On-site transfer of development intensity and density.* In order to protect nature parks and public conservation/preservation areas, development intensity and density for building areas may be transferred from areas near the park to areas remote from the park within the same property or adjacent property under same ownership and zoning category.

5. *Buffer/fencing.* In order to avoid encroachment by invasive exotic plants, pets, livestock and fowl, and yard or trash debris, new development on parcels larger than two acres or new subdivisions shall leave a buffer at least 25 feet in width extending from the boundary of the nature park and public conservation/preservation area to be left in a generally undisturbed native plant condition. Buffers shall remain common open space or within the boundaries of a single lot or parcel. As an alternative to the buffer requirement, where sufficient justification is presented (such as, but not limited to, hardship due to configuration of the property, the extensive presence of invasive exotic plants or a need to confine pets) and approved at the time of development review, new development adjacent to a nature park and public conservation/preservation area may be allowed to install and maintain a fence along the property boundary between the nature park and public conservation/preservation area and the development area.

D. *Expansion or alteration of existing uses.*

1. Whenever expansion of an existing structure, independently or cumulatively, accomplished after June 10, 1992, totals 2,000 square feet or more than 20 percent of the gross square footage of the existing structure, whichever is less, the entire site shall be brought into compliance with this section. For the purposes of this subsection, repeated expansions or alterations of property, including the construction or erection of separate buildings or accessory structures, constructed over a period of time commencing after November 21, 1983, which meet the above threshold, shall comply with the provisions of this section.

2. Any new use of property that alters the use of existing structures from a residential use to a nonresidential use, or any use of property that alters the use of property from one use to any other use, shall be required to meet all applicable requirements of this section.

1. *Subdivisions.* In addition to compliance with subsection B.3. of this section, subdivisions shall comply with article III. For cluster subdivisions, refer also to section 30-6.7.

2. *Developments other than subdivisions.* For developments requiring development plan review other than subdivisions, where the designated greenway corridors lie inside a floodplain or required surface water or wetlands setback, whichever is more landward, the appropriate review board shall determine if there is a rough proportionality between the projected impact of the development on traffic and recreational needs and the nature and amount of property in the development encompassing the greenway. In making this determination, the board shall consider the factors listed in section 30-6.6. If the board finds the necessary proportionality, the applicant shall dedicate, to the city or a qualified agency designated by the city, a greenway right-of-way which encompasses the designated greenway.

3. *Greenway width and location.* The minimum width of the greenway corridor shall be 15 feet. For properties containing a creek, the corridor shall be at least ten feet landward of the top of bank of the creek. For properties containing a lake or wetland, the corridor shall be at least ten feet landward of the landward extent of the lake or wetland. For creeks, lakes and wetlands, the city manager or designee may require a distance greater than ten feet when necessary to avoid significant harm to creek vegetation, water quality or creek bank soils. Top of bank and landward extent shall be determined by the city manager or designee. Reduced widths may be approved by the city manager or designee when necessitated by environmental or infrastructure constraints. The corridor shall be located so as to correspond with the entire length of the designated greenway as it passes through the subject property, and shall be aligned to connect with existing or potential greenways and other bicycle/pedestrian circulation systems on the parcel and on adjacent parcels.

4. *On-site transfer of development intensity and density.* In order to promote or preserve the integrity of designated greenways, development intensity and density for building areas may be transferred from areas near the greenway to areas remote from the greenway within the same property or adjacent property under the same ownership and zoning category.

C. *Credit awarded for provision of greenway.*

1. *Increased development intensity points.* Refer to the density bonus points manual as adopted by resolution of the city commission.

2. *Landscape credit.* Developments dedicating a greenway corridor as specified by the density bonus points manual are awarded a 30 percent reduction in the amount of tree and vegetation landscaping required by this chapter.

3. *Setback and lot coverage credit.* Developments dedicating a greenway corridor may include the dedicated corridor as part of its setback, if the corridor would have otherwise been part of the setback. The area of the corridor may also be considered as open space in calculations of lot coverage.

D. *Demonstration of compliance for developments requiring development plan review.* If a proposed development requires development plan review pursuant to this chapter, the showing of compliance with the requirements of this section shall be made in development plan review. The petition for development plan review shall provide both a hydrological report prepared by a qualified engineer registered in the State of Florida, as well as a map showing the location of the greenway corridor as it passes through the subject property.

#### DIVISION 7. RELIEF AND ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 30-8.43. Relief for reasonable or beneficial use.

A. *Landscape and tree management.* The preservation of any existing regulated tree identified on the Gainesville tree list as being a high quality shade species may be considered as a basis for the granting of a variance pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter.

B. *Surface waters and wetlands.* As regards the provisions of surface waters and wetlands sections of this article, the following standards and measures of relief shall apply:

1. An applicant may be entitled to relief in the form of a minimum beneficial use if he/she demonstrates that private property rights are vested in accordance with the procedures and provisions set forth in article X. The relief which the applicant may receive shall be as follows:

a. The city may purchase the land from the owner for an amount based upon an appraisal completed by an M.A.I. appraiser to be selected and paid by the city. If the owner desires a review of this M.A.I. appraisal, the owner may select a reviewer and the city will provide and pay for such a review. The appraised value of the land shall not be affected by consideration of the provisions of this article; or

b. The development review board may grant a variance from the provisions of this article to the minimum extent necessary to allow reasonable development in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

2. Emergency procedure for surface waters and wetlands. The owner of any real property affected by this article may file written application with the city manager or designee in order to undertake emergency measures to prevent damage to any of the regulated creeks, lakes or wetlands. The enforcing official may grant authorization to the property owner that will expedite the city's effort to protect the public health, safety and welfare. The authorization for emergency action is temporary only and shall expire within 60 calendar days or upon the next regularly scheduled meeting of the development review board, whichever is sooner. Upon receipt of temporary emergency authorization, the recipient shall apply to the development review board for authorization for any permanent measures. The authorization by the city will not relieve the property owner from securing any necessary state permits prior to commencement of work.

C. *Floodplain management.* As regards to floodplain management provisions of this article, the development review board may issue a variance in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the following provisions:

1. *Criteria for relief.* In addition to the relief provisions of this chapter, the following criteria for relief shall apply:

a. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

b. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

c. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

f. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

g. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program of that area;

h. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use;

i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.

2. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection C.1. of this section, and the purpose of the floodplain management sections of this article, the development review board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these sections.

3. The city manager or designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the federal insurance administrator (Federal Emergency Management Administration), upon request.

4. Variances shall not be issued within any regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels would result during a base flood discharge. Conditions for variances are as follows:

a. Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size contiguous to, and surrounded by, lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the factors of subsection C.1. of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

b. Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of these sections upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

c. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

d. Variances shall only be issued upon:

i. A showing of good and sufficient cause;

ii. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

iii. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with the local government's Comprehensive Plan or with other existing local laws or ordinances.

e. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

5. *Special use permit.* The city plan board may grant a special use permit in accordance with the procedures provided in article III to allow any of the permitted use listed in section 30-8.30 regardless of the zoning district in which the parcel is located, provided the board makes the following findings:

a. A showing that no use permitted within the applicable zoning district can reasonably be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter;

b. A showing that the parcel cannot be combined with a contiguous parcel under the same ownership and thereby used in conformity with the applicable zoning regulations; and

c. A determination that the granting of a special use permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with other existing laws and ordinances.

The city plan board shall also consider all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

d. The size of the parcel, and whether it was platted as a lot suitable for development or otherwise established and recognized by the city as an individual lot suitable for development;

e. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands causing injury to others;

f. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

g. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and floodplain management program of that area;

i. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for private and emergency vehicles;

j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the potential floodwaters and the potential effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site;

k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as power, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and

l. The compatibility of the proposed use with nearby properties and uses.

Upon consideration of the factors in this section and the purposes of this chapter, the city plan board may attach such conditions and restrictions upon the special use permit, including a limitation of the extent or type of uses permitted, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

3. Any stormwater facility that is found by the city manager or designee to be contributing to mosquito control problems is in violation of this article and the property owner shall immediately correct the problem at the owner's expense.

4. Prior to construction of a stormwater facility, a pollution prevention plan shall be submitted to the city manager or designee for approval. The pollution prevention plan shall detail specific best management practices for installation on a construction site and that when installed have the net effect of preventing a deposit, obstruction, damage or process problem to any of the city's stormwater management facilities or to the surface waters of the state. If such deposit, obstruction, damage or process problem occurs this occurrence shall be a violation of this article and the property owner shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be immediately removed or cause the damage or process problem to be immediately repaired.

Discharge from any facility that causes a deposit, obstruction, damage or process problem to any of the city's stormwater management facilities or to the surface waters of the state is a violation of this article and the property owner shall cause the deposit or obstruction to be immediately removed or cause the damage or process problem to be immediately repaired.

5. Any temporary or permanent erosion or sedimentation control device that is unable to perform continuous effective control shall be a violation of this article and the property owner shall immediately correct the control device so that it performs continuous effective control. Such correction or repair shall be taken at the owner's expense.

6. If an approved maintenance plan is not being adhered to, the property owner shall be in violation of this article and shall immediately resume adherence to the approved maintenance plan.

7. Should any person violate the provisions of this section, the city manager or designee shall require the alleged violator to take corrective measures. In the event the alleged violator does not immediately correct the violation, the city may, depending upon the severity of the violation, take the following actions:

a. If the city manager or designee finds a violation of this article or a violation of any provision of a property owner's pollution prevention plan, which has been provided to the city, is not immediately rectified, the city manager or designee shall notify the property owner of the violation within five calendar days of inspection and shall give the property owner a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the city manager or designee shall issue a notice of violation to the alleged violator and shall notify the code enforcement board to request a hearing. The board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed to the property owner as provided in section 2-390 of the Code of Ordinances. In the case of notice provided under subsection 2-390(a), notice shall be given at least seven calendar days in advance of the hearing, not counting the day of the hearing. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the inspector, the case may be presented to the board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing.

b. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the city manager or designee finds a violation of this article in relation to a city-issued permit or finds a violation of the pollution prevention plan has occurred that presents an imminent risk to the environment, the city manager or designee may issue a cease and desist order for any and all development on the site related to the permit. Any person receiving such an order for cessation of operations shall immediately comply with the requirements thereof. It shall be a violation of this Code for any person to fail to or refuse to comply with a cease and desist order issued once written notice of the cease and desist order is delivered by hand delivery or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person to whom the permit is issued.

If the city manager or designee issues a cease and desist order pursuant to this Code, the property owner shall immediately cease all work on the site until the violation is corrected or mitigated. The property owner shall have the right to appeal to the appropriate reviewing authority the administrative decision of the city manager or designee to issue a cease and desist order and shall show cause why the cease and desist order should be lifted. Any appeal shall not stay the cease and desist order.

8. The city manager or designee may enter into consent agreements, assurances or voluntary compliance documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within the time period as specified in the document. Such documents may provide for judicial enforcement.

9. In addition to all remedies provided above, in the event of failure to comply with any requirement of this section or in the event a violation of this section is occurring in the absence of a city-issued permit, the city manager may request the city attorney's office seek injunctive relief in a court of equitable jurisdiction so that the property owner will cease any and all activity on the site.

10. The remedies provided in this section shall not be exclusive, and are in addition to any other remedies available to the county, state or federal government; and the city may seek whatever remedies are authorized in Code against any person or user for violating the provisions of this section.

B. *Landscape and tree management.* As regards the provisions of the landscape and tree management sections, the enforcing official shall regularly inspect properties within the city to determine whether the areas devoted to landscape materials are in accordance with the provisions of these sections.

1. *Performance standards.* Performance standards for regulated trees shall be as follows:

a. *Purpose.* In order to assist the enforcing official, the code enforcement board and/or appropriate judicial forum in remedying a violation of the landscape and tree management sections of this article and ordering appropriate corrective action against the owner of the property as listed on the current tax assessor's tax roll, or other address of record, and/or the person committing any violation of these sections, there are adopted the following performance standards which meet the objectives of these sections.

b. *Minimum requirements.*

i. A tree that was established in compliance with a development order but which has been removed from the site or has died shall be replaced with a tree that meets the requirements of this article. The species should be the same as specified on the approved landscaping plan. If a different species is desired, it shall fill the required function - for example, a small flowering tree cannot replace a high quality shade tree. Whenever required street trees are removed to allow for infrastructure improvement projects along a street, they shall be replaced by the entity responsible for the improvement project.

ii. High quality trees shall be used as mitigation trees for any trees that were removed without a permit. Mitigation trees should be planted on site in all the locations that would be required by code to bring the landscaping into compliance with current standards have been filled. The remainder of the mitigation trees may, as determined by the city manager or designee, be established on other appropriate sites within the city limits or may be given to the city tree-planting program.

iii. All replacement or mitigation trees shall be nursery-grown trees. They may be balled and burlapped, tree spaded or containerized.

iv. Replacement or mitigation trees shall be located in approximately the same location as the regulated tree that has died or has been removed from the site, unless such location does not meet utility separation requirements or would conflict with other requirements in the chapter in which event the location shall be determined by the city manager or designee.

v. Replacement or mitigation trees may only be planted during the months of November through March, unless the trees are containerized or the site is served by an automatic irrigation system.

vi. The total sum of the caliper inches of replacement or mitigation trees shall equal, at a minimum, to the total sum of the caliper inches of the regulated trees which were removed without a permit. If a regulated tree was removed without a permit, then the required mitigation shall be double what is required as in mitigation in this article. It shall be assumed that the tree removed without a permit was in fair or better condition.

2. *Reinspection.* The enforcing official shall inspect the property upon completion of all corrective action or order issued pursuant to the landscape and tree management sections of this article to determine compliance. The enforcing official shall then reinspect the property approximately one month thereafter and then at four-month intervals to ensure compliance. If at any time the enforcing official determines that the corrective action is not successful, he/she shall notify the owner and/or resident of the property as provided in subsection B.1. of this section.

However, any condition found to exist in violation of this sign code that constitutes a hazard to the public safety shall be required to be abated immediately.

D. *Unauthorized signs in right-of-way.* Any sign placed in the public right-of-way in violation of this sign code shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be removed immediately by an enforcing official or agent. Any sign so removed may be disposed of by the city without notice or compensation. This removal shall not preclude prosecution or imposition of penalties for violation of this sign code.

E. The enforcing official or agent may cause any sign that is a hazard or poses immediate peril to persons or property to be removed immediately at the expense of the owner, lessee or other person having beneficial use of the sign, or the owner or lessee of the land upon which the sign is located.

### ARTICLE X. NONCONFORMITIES AND VESTED RIGHTS

#### DIVISION 1. NONCONFORMITIES

Sec. 30-10.1. Purpose.

The purpose of this division is to provide regulations for the continuation and elimination of lots, structures, and uses that are deemed legal nonconformities, subject to the restrictions set forth herein.

Sec. 30-10.2. Generally.

A. *Legal nonconformity status.* A legal nonconformity means an existing lot, structure or use that was in compliance with the Land Development Code requirements that were in effect when the lot, structure or use was established, but which no longer conforms to one or more requirements of the Land Development Code or amendments thereto in effect. Legal nonconformity status shall be determined by the city manager or designee and the burden shall be on the property owner/developer to establish such status.

B. *Right to continue legal nonconformity.* Unless otherwise provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions set forth herein, legal nonconformities existing on the effective date of this chapter or amendments thereto may be continued.

C. *Nonconformities other than legal nonconformities.* All nonconformities that are not deemed legal nonconformities shall be brought into compliance with this chapter and may be enforced as a violation of this chapter.

D. *Nonconformities created by eminent domain proceedings.* A lot, structure or site improvement that has or will be rendered nonconforming because of a taking through eminent domain proceedings or by the voluntary conveyance of a portion of land under the threat of eminent domain proceedings by a governmental authority shall be deemed conforming.

Sec. 30-10.3. Nonconforming lots.

A. *Certain lots deemed conforming.* A legally nonconforming lot that meets the following criteria shall be deemed conforming:

1. The lot is located within 500 feet of two or more lots that:

a. Are developed with a principal structure, and

b. Share a substantially similar degree of the same nonconformity (lot area, lot depth, or lot width).

B. *Combining lots.* If a nonconforming lot abuts one or more other lots in the same ownership, such lots shall be legally combined to eliminate the nonconformity before the city may approve any development permits for the lots.

C. *Dwellings on nonconforming lots.* A legally nonconforming lot that is not a substandard lot and that does not abut another lot in the same ownership may be used for a single-family dwelling in zoning districts that allow the use, provided that all other applicable regulations of the zoning district can be met. No multiple-family dwellings shall be allowed on nonconforming lots in any district that allows single-family dwellings.

D. *Buildings on nonconforming lots.* Provided that all other applicable regulations of the zoning district can be met, the city manager or designee may authorize the issuance of a building permit for a building to be located on a legally nonconforming or substandard lot if the applicant can demonstrate both:

1. That the impacts of the nonconforming lot are minimal upon the surrounding land uses and are not detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; and

2. That the impacts of the nonconforming lot may be substantially mitigated through measures including but not limited to: buffering; screening; landscaping; architectural treatment; additional setbacks; access limitations; limitations on use; sufficient parking designed to provide safe internal traffic circulation and off-site access; and site plan design to minimize off-site impacts of service and delivery areas, refuse and recycling collection areas, and outdoor storage and work areas.

(Ord. No. 2023-528, § 2, 9-7-23)

Sec. 30-10.4. Nonconforming structures and site improvements.

A. *Applicability.* This section applies to all nonconforming structures and site improvements within the city. However, when another section of this chapter imposes more specific provisions for a particular nonconforming structure or site improvement, such as nonconforming signs, the provisions of that section shall govern.

B. *Repair, maintenance, reconstruction, remodel.* Any structure or site improvement legally nonconforming as to dimensional requirements, site improvement requirements, or development standards may receive the following work without being made to conform to this chapter, provided such work neither contributes to nor increases the specific legal nonconformity and provided it is otherwise in conformance with the requirements of this chapter. With the exception of single-family buildings or structures which have no such limitation, the cost of the work shall not exceed 50 percent of the structural value (the present cost of replacing the structure or site improvement); otherwise, the structure or site improvement shall be made to fully comply with this chapter.

1. Repair and maintenance, meaning any actions that correct defects in, extend the useful life of, or bring the structure or site improvement into conformance with applicable building, electrical, mechanical, fire, health, safety or related regulations;

2. Reconstruction, meaning the rebuilding of a structure or site improvement that has been damaged or destroyed; and

3. Remodel, meaning any change to or modification of the physical appearance of a structure or site improvement.

C. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening of or restoring to a safe condition any structure or site improvement or part thereof declared to be unsafe by an order of a city or state official charged with protecting the public health or safety.

Sec. 30-10.5. Nonconforming uses.

A. *Limitation on enlarging, increasing or extending use.* A legally nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, extended or intensified, including to cover more area of the land or building or structure than was occupied by that use when it became legally nonconforming, except a legally nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building or structure that were manifestly arranged or intended for such use at the time the nonconformity status was established.

B. *Alterations to structures and site improvements associated with legally nonconforming uses.* A structure associated with a legally nonconforming use may receive the following alterations, provided such work otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter:

1. Ordinary repair and maintenance, meaning any actions that correct defects in, extend the useful life of, or bring the structure or site improvement into conformance with applicable building, electrical, mechanical, fire, health, safety or related regulations;

2. Site improvements to the premises of structures associated with legally nonconforming uses, including landscaping, drainage, lighting, and the provision of buffering and screening along property boundaries; and

3. Alterations made to comply with the requirements of law, including making a nonconforming structure or site improvement conforming to the requirements of this chapter.

C. *Change of use.* A legally nonconforming use shall not be changed to another use unless such use is permitted by and complies with all applicable requirements of this chapter. If a legally nonconforming use is changed to any other use, said use shall lose its legally nonconforming status and any subsequent use shall conform to all applicable requirements of this chapter.

D. *Abandonment.* If a legally nonconforming use is deemed abandoned in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, said use shall lose its legally nonconforming status and any subsequent use shall conform to all applicable requirements of this chapter.

1. *Review criteria.* Abandoned means to cease the use for a continuous period equaling or exceeding nine months. Evidence, including public records, utility records, property records, verified personal records, or other general research and documentation, shall demonstrate that a use or activity has not been abandoned. The intent of the owner or user shall not be relevant in determining whether the use has been abandoned. The time period of any legal proceedings related to change of ownership, including foreclosures or bankruptcies, shall not be used in any calculation of the time period for abandonment.

2. *Review procedure.*

a. The burden shall be on the property owner/developer to establish that a use has not been abandoned.

b. At such time as city staff or the city plan board determines that reasons exist for a property to lose its legal nonconformity status, notice of such determination shall be given to the property owner by the city. The notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, shall clearly state the reasons for the determination, and shall advise the property owner that a hearing to consider the determination shall be held by the city plan board on a date not less than 30 calendar days following the date of the notice. The time and place of the hearing shall be specified in the notice.

c. A quasi-judicial public hearing shall be conducted by the city plan board with respect to all proceedings regarding loss of legal nonconformity status. A staff report shall be prepared and shall contain a recommendation as to the appropriate course of action. Where such proceedings have been instituted against a group of similarly situated nonconformities, such proceedings may be consolidated for hearing purposes.

d. Following the close of the public hearing, the city plan board shall render its decision no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the hearing. The decision shall be supported by written findings and a record of the proceeding shall be kept.

e. *Appeals.* The determination of the city plan board shall be final, subject to such remedies as may be provided in this chapter or at law.

E. *Reinstatement of abandoned legally nonconforming use.* A legally nonconforming use that was deemed abandoned in accordance with subsection D. above, and thereby lost its status as a legally nonconforming use, may be reinstated as a legally nonconforming use in accordance with the terms of this subsection E. The process set forth herein shall be applicable only to the status of legally nonconforming uses of land and shall not apply to any other development criteria or regulation in this chapter.

1. *Review criteria.* The applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating each of the following:

a. That the use requested to be reinstated is the same as the former legally nonconforming use that was deemed abandoned, and is therefore not a change in use;

b. That the impacts of the nonconforming use are minimal upon the surrounding land uses and are not detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare; and

c. That the impacts of the nonconforming use may be substantially mitigated through measures including but not limited to: buffering; screening; landscaping; architectural treatment; additional setbacks; access limitations; limitations on use; sufficient parking designed to provide safe internal traffic circulation and off-site access; and site plan design to minimize off-site impacts of service and delivery areas, refuse and recycling collection areas, and outdoor storage and work areas.

2. *Review procedure.*

a. Upon application of the property owner, a staff report shall be prepared and shall contain a recommendation as to the appropriate course of action. The city plan board shall conduct a quasi-judicial public hearing and shall apply the criteria set forth above to grant, grant with conditions, or deny an application for reinstatement. The notice and hearing procedure shall be the same as for rezonings.

b. Following the close of the public hearing, the city plan board shall render its decision no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the hearing. The decision shall be supported by written findings and a record of the proceeding shall be kept.

c. *Appeals.* The determination of the city plan board shall be final, subject to such remedies as may be provided in this chapter or at law.

#### DIVISION 2. VESTED RIGHTS

Sec. 30-10.6. Purpose.

This division establishes the administrative procedures and standards by which a property owner may demonstrate that private property rights have vested against the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter, and therefore development on said private property may continue notwithstanding that the development does not conform to the requirements of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter.

Sec. 30-10.7. Vested rights criteria.

A. *Presumptive vested rights.* The following categories shall be presumptively vested:

1. All active and valid final development orders issued by the city prior to the effective date of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter or any applicable amendments thereto, provided all material requirements, conditions, limitations and regulations of the development order have been met.

2. All complete building permit applications that are approvable in their submitted form, and received by the building official prior to the effective date of this chapter or any applicable amendments thereto. This provision shall not be used to find any presumptive vested rights against the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or amendments thereto.

3. All lots within a subdivision that has been recorded prior to the effective date of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter or any applicable amendments thereto, or lots in approved unrecorded subdivisions for which streets, stormwater management facilities, utilities and other infrastructure required for the development have been completed prior to the effective date of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter or any applicable amendments thereto.

4. Lots of record not located within a subdivision, but only to the extent of one single-family residence per lot. Such lots of record shall: 1) conform to the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and this chapter that are currently in effect; 2) have legally conformed under previously effective provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter; or 3) have existed prior to any applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter. Certified copies of deeds and subdivision plats recorded in the office of the clerk of circuit court, or records of lot splits maintained by the city, will prove the time of a lot's existence.

5. Any structure for which construction has been completed and a certificate of occupancy has been issued, if a certificate of occupancy was required at the time of permitting.

B. *Nonpresumptive vested rights.* The appropriate reviewing authority shall consider all of the following factors, as well as any other relevant factors, to determine whether an applicant has nonpresumptive vested rights:

1. Whether there was a valid and unexpired act or omission of the city.

a. An "act" of the city may include but is not limited to an issued permit or authorization to commence development. An "omission" of the city means more than government silence or inaction, but rather a negligent or culpable omission where the party failing to act was under a lawful duty to act.

2. Whether the applicant, in reasonable and good faith reliance on the above act or omission, has made a substantial change in position or incurred extensive obligations and expenses.

a. An applicant does not act in good faith when the applicant made a substantial change in position or incurred extensive obligations and expenses in a situation where the applicant knew or reasonably should have known that changes to applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter were pending, whereby "pending" means: 1) there were active and documented efforts in the normal course of municipal action that would culminate in the change of applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan or this chapter, and 2) the city commission or the city plan board knew of such efforts.

b. The appropriate reviewing authority shall not consider the following as development expenditures or obligations:

i. Expenditures for legal and other professional services that are not related to the design or construction of improvements.

ii. Expenditures related to a rezoning action.

iii. Taxes paid.

iv. Expenditures for initial acquisition of the land.

3. Whether, because of the above substantial change in position or extensive obligations and expenses incurred, it would be highly inequitable and unjust to deny the applicant's right to develop or to continue the development of the property. In making this determination, the appropriate reviewing authority shall consider the following as well as any other relevant factors:

a. Whether the development activity has commenced and is continuing in good faith.

b. Whether the expense or obligations already incurred can be substantially used, including use and application of any plans, materials, studies, permits, approvals and services acquired, for a development that is allowable and in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

C. *Limitations.*

1. If vested rights were determined based on the possession of a final development order or other unexpired city action, vested rights shall expire with expiration of that final development order or action.

2. Any vested rights determination shall not create vested rights for additional phases or additional development not expressly authorized by the final development order. This section does not apply to any other subsequent final development order that may also be required for project completion, provided the densities and intensities allowed under the initial final development order are not increased and the specific development plan approved under the initial final development order remains substantially unchanged.

3. All development subject to a vested rights determination shall not deviate from the terms of the development orders or actions upon which the vested rights determination was based.

4. A vested rights determination shall run with the land and is therefore transferable to subsequent owners of the subject property.

Sec. 30-10.8. Vested rights determination process.

A. *Application for vested rights determination.* Any person claiming vested rights to develop property shall submit to the city a sworn application for a vested rights determination. The application shall be on a form provided by the city, and shall include the following information:

1. The name, signature and address of all owners of the property;

2. The name and address of the applicant(s), who shall be the owner(s) or an agent authorized by affidavit to apply on behalf of the owner(s);

3. A legal description and survey of the subject property;

4. A copy of any approved and unexpired final development orders, which may include a final site plan, final subdivision plat or building plan;

5. Identification by specific reference to any ordinance, resolution or other action of the city, or failure by the city to act, upon which the applicant relied and which the applicant believes supports the vested rights claim;

6. A statement of facts that the applicant intends to prove in support of the application; and

7. Such other relevant information that the city may request.

B. *Staff determination.*

1. *Complete applications.* No later than ten calendar days following the date of receiving an application, the city manager or designee shall make a written determination as to whether the application is complete in accordance with this division.

2. *Staff decision.* No later than 30 calendar days following the date of the city manager or designee's determination that an application is complete, the city manager or designee shall review the application and make a written determination whether the application clearly and unequivocally has vested rights in accordance with the criteria for presumptive or nonpresumptive vesting. No later than seven calendar days following the date of the city manager or designee's written determination of vested rights, the city manager or designee shall provide the applicant written notification of the determination. The applicant shall have the right to rely upon such written notification that the proposed development is vested; such determination that the development is vested shall be final and not subject to administrative appeal, revocation or modification.

C. *Appeals.*

1. *Purpose.* It is the purpose of this section to provide an administrative process for appealing a written decision of the city manager or designee that denies vested rights. In particular, it is intended that such administrative relief be provided in the most professional, objective, and equitable manner possible through the adjudication of matters as provided herein by the land use hearing officer (hearing officer) provided by this chapter. No party shall be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies for the purpose of seeking judicial review unless the party first obtains review by a hearing officer as provided herein.

2. *Standard of review.* The hearing officer's review shall be de novo, meaning the review is not limited to the record that was before the city manager or designee or limited to the first-tier certiorari standard of review. However, if the record that was before the city manager or designee is full and complete, the hearing officer may determine that the record is the only evidence that is necessary. The hearing officer may also determine that additional evidence and oral or written testimony, including cross examination, is necessary to properly evaluate the city manager or designee's decision.

3. *Appeal process.* The applicant may appeal to a hearing officer a decision of the city manager or designee that denies vested rights. The appeal process shall be as follows:

a. No later than 30 calendar days following the date of the city manager or designee's written determination of vested rights, the applicant may appeal to a hearing officer by filing a notice of appeal with the city manager or designee together with a nonrefundable filing fee of $500.00. The notice of appeal shall set forth in detail the basis of the appeal.

b. All expenses associated with the hearing officer appeal process, except attorney fees, shall be the responsibility of the nonprevailing party.

c. The city shall accurately and completely preserve all testimony in the proceeding, and, at the request of any party, it shall make a full or partial transcript or existing hearing record available at no more than actual cost.

d. In any case where a notice of appeal has been filed, the decision of the city manager or designee shall be stayed pending the final determination of the case.

4. *Hearing process.* The hearing before the hearing officer shall be conducted as follows:

a. The hearing officer shall set forth at the outset of the hearing the order of the proceedings and the rules under which the hearing will be conducted.

b. The order of presentation at the hearing shall be as follows:

i. Receipt of any exhibits or records of the city manager or designee.

ii. Opening statements by the parties.

iii. Appellant's case.

iv. Respondent's case.

v. Rebuttal by appellant.

vi. Summation by respondent.

vii. Summation by appellant.

viii. Conclusion of the hearing by the hearing officer.

c. The city manager or designee's records, including all exhibits, shall be received and constitute a part of the record.

d. The hearing officer shall have the authority to determine the applicability and relevance of all materials, exhibits, and testimony and to exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or repetitious matter.

e. The hearing officer shall administer oaths to witnesses.

f. The cross examination of witnesses shall be permitted, in a reasonable amount as determined by the hearing officer.

g. The time for presentation of a case shall be determined by the hearing officer.

h. The hearing officer may allow the parties to submit written findings of fact and conclusions of law following the hearing, and shall advise the parties to the timetable for so doing if allowed.

5. *Hearing officer decision.* No later than 30 calendar days following the date of the appeal hearing, the hearing officer shall file with the city manager or designee, with a copy to the applicant and the city clerk, a written determination that includes appropriate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decisions in the matter of the appeal. The decision of the hearing officer, which may affirm, affirm with conditions, or reverse the decision of the city manager or designee, shall be based upon the criteria for presumptive or nonpresumptive vesting as established in this division, and shall be guided by the Comprehensive Plan, this chapter, and established case law. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final, subject to judicial review.

6. *Judicial review.* Judicial review of the hearing officer's decision is available to the property owner and the city and shall be by common-law certiorari to the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court. In any case where judicial review is sought, the decision of the hearing officer shall be stayed pending the final determination of the case.
