# GNV Code of Ordinances Project
The cost of housing in Gainesville is too high! City government cannot implement or cannot afford alternative ways to reduce housing costs, like public housing or rent freezes, so we must make it easier to build more housing, because increasing the supply of a good is a tried-and-true method for reducing its price.

Therefore, we will research and propose changes to city ordinances that incentivize the production of more housing, which could make life more affordable for everyone living here.

# Proposal
1. Identify Gainesville ordinances that reduce the supply of housing
2. Identify similar cities with friendlier regulation
3. Propose edits to Gainesville ordinances that balance:
    1. creating the best possible environment for increasing the supply of housing, with
    2. changing existing ordinance as little as possible
4. Explain how these edits achieve 3.1 and 3.2, with references
5. Convince the city commission to adopt these measures as a privately initiated ordinance amendment
